Day 13: Redo uses parallel processing.
2015: 733 725 (0.082448s,0.609423s,0.691871s)
redo: 733 725 (0.0114s,0.089556s,0.100956s)

redo: 2640 1102 (0.000551s,0.01803s,0.018581s)

Day 15: Redo uses parallel processing.
2015: 222870 117936 (0.835913s,0.581658s,1.417571s)
redo: 222870 117936 (0.481678s,0.463297s,0.944975s)

Day 16:
2015: 103 405 (0.013504s,0.007016s,0.02052s)
redo: 103 405 (0.001918s,0.007223s,0.009141s)

Day 17:
2015: 1638 17 (0.129982s,0.122576s,0.252558s)
redo: 1638 17 (0.04802s,0.047901s,0.095921s)

Day 18: Redo uses bits where the 2015 code used Set (Int,Int).
2015: 821 886 (7.738247s,7.889655s,15.627902s)
redo: 821 886 (2.156928s,2.123705s,4.280633s)

Day 19: Redo assumes that there are atoms that never get replaced and
        only appear at the end of replacements in order to prune the
        search space.  The 2015 code hard-codes all the rules in my
        input.
2015: 535 212 (0.067067s,0.029427s,0.096494s)
redo: 535 212 (0.050021s,0.00287s,0.052891s)

Day 20: Redo adds prime factors while the 2015 code uses brute force.
        Not sure if the redo algorithm cuts off the search too early,
        but it works for my input.
2015: 665280 705600 (15.47634s,16.934021s,32.410361s)
redo: 665280 705600 (0.74827s,0.519474s,1.267744s)

Day 21:
2015: 91 158 (0.002263s,0.003118s,0.005381s)
redo: 91 158 (0.002017s,0.001956s,0.003973s)

Day 22: Redo uses A* while the 2015 code uses a depth-first search.
2015: 900 1216 (0.515808s,2.549098s,3.064906s)
redo: 900 1216 (0.045178s,0.062636s,0.107814s)

Day 23:
2015: 170 247 (0.003665s,0.001986s,0.005651s)
redo: 170 247 (0.004195s,0.005347s,0.009542s)

Day 24:

redo: 11266889531 77387711 (20.433829s,4.37918s,24.813009s)

Day 25:
2015: 2650453 () (20.502543s,0.000029s,20.502572s)
redo: 2650453 () (17.055729s,0.00004s,17.055769s)
