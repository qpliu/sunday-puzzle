20200417 Riddler Classic
========================
With some [code](20200417c.hs) to brute force test every state
for a given _N_ to see if it returns to that state within a small
number of steps, which should be much less than _2³ⁿ_, since there
are many redundant states, due to rotational and translational
symmetries.

There are no oscillators for _N < 4_.

For _N = 4_, there are 4096 states (including redundancies), and
4 of them (including redundancies) are oscillators with period 2.

Two of them are
```
1100   0011
1100 ⇔ 0011
1100   0011
```

The other two are
```
0110   1001
0110 ⇔ 1001
0110   1001
```
