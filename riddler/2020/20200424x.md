==========================
The diagonal of a 5cm² square is √50cm, which is slightly more than 7cm.  But
I don't see how, with one cut, make half of a 7cm² square fit on a 5cm² square.

But with two diagonal cuts, the 7cm² square becomes 4 equal triangles with 7cm
hypotenuses.  Putting two of the triangles on each of the 5cm² squares
satisfies the requirement.
