Doing the extra credit version, since it's a generalization.

Since there is no way to distinguish between the prisoners, each prisoner
needs to follow the same algorithm: if the random number is less than _r_,
then flip, otherwise, don't flip.

Then, for each prisoner, the chance of flipping tails is _½r_, and the
chance of not flipping is _1 - r_.

The chance that nobody flipped tails is _(1 - ½r)<sup>N</sup>_,
and the chance that nobody flipped is _(1 - r)<sup>N</sup>_,
so the chance of being released is
_R = (1 - ½r)<sup>N</sup> - (1 - r)<sup>N</sup>_.

If _r = 0_, then _R = 0_.

If _r = 1_, then _R = 1/2<sup>N</sup>_.

Trying to find the maximum _R_ with respect to _r_,
_dR/dr = -½N(1 - ½r)<sup>N-1</sup> + N(1 - r)<sup>N-1</sup> = 0_, or
_½(1 - ½r)<sup>N-1</sup> = (1 - r)<sup>N-1</sup>.

Also, _0 < r < 1_, and _d<sup>2</sup>R/dr<sup>2</sup> < 0_.

Solving for _r_ gives

![r = (2-2^(1+1/(N-1)))/(1-2^(1+1/(N-1)))](20200501c.svg)

which can be used to calculate _R = (1 - ½r)<sup>N</sup> - (1 - r)<sup>N</sup>_.

For _N = 4_, the maximum is _R ≈ 0.285_, when _r ≈ 0.342_.
