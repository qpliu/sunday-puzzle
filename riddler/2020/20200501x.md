==========================
Arbitrarily decree that the cross-sectional slices are horizontal slices.

From the top and bottom, the crystal would look like a square, with sides
rotated 45° from the sides of the rectangular cross-sections.  (Or maybe a
rhombus.)

From four specific angles from the sides, the crystal would look like a
triangle.  For two of them, 180° apart, the triangle has two vertices at
the bottom and one vertex at the top.  For the other two, 90° from the
irst two, the triangle has one vertex at the top and two vertices at the
bottom.
