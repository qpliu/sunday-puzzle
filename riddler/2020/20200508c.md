==========================
The surface area of the spherical apple is _S = 4πR<sup>2</sup>_,
where _R_ is 4cm.

The polar angle of the edge of a bite is _𝜃 = r/R_, where _r_ is 1cm,
so the area of a bite is _B = 2πR<sup>2</sup>(1 - cos𝜃)_.

Let _U<sub>n</sub>_ be the expected unbitten surface area after _n_ minutes.
Then, _U<sub>n+1</sub> = U<sub>n</sub>(1 - B/S)_.

Since _U<sub>0</sub> = S_, _U<sub>n</sub> = S(1 - B/S)<sup>n</sup>_.

_B/S = 2 - 2cos𝜃 ≈ 0.0622_

The expected unbitten area, which could be disjoint, exponentially decays to
zero.  After 44 minutes, the expected unbitten surface area is less than the
area of one bite.

The calculation of the average time to finish eating the apple would be
dominated by the possible infinite times, so the average time to eat the
apple is ∞.
