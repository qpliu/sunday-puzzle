Question 1: There are 21 tiles that are not doubles and 7 tiles that are
doubles, so the chance of randomly drawing a double is 7/28, or 1/4.

Question 2: The chance of randomly drawing a double is still 1/4, and the
chance that half of the tile has any particular number is 1/4, and the
chance that half of the tile has a number is 1.  There are 7 tiles
with any particular number, only one of which is a double.

So is the chance that a randomly drawn tile with a particular number on
half of it is a double is 1/7.

Running [code](20200508x.hs) that randomly draws tiles substantiates these
numbers.

How to make sense of this non-intuitive discrepency?  The chance of drawing
any particular number is 7/28, and 1/7 of that is the double.  Since there
are overlaps between the numbers, but no overlap between the doubles, so the
odds of drawing the numbers minus the overlaps add up to 28/28, while the
odds of drawing doubles add up to 7/28.
