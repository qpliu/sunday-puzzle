==========================
Let _r_ be the radius of the muffin, _θ_ be the angle of the side cut
segments, and _b_ be the length of the middle bar.

The areas of the side cut segments must be _r²_(_θ_ - sin_θ_) = ¼ _πr²_.

Let _h_ be the height of the middle cut isosceles triangle, and 𝛼 be its
apex angle, then

_b/2h_ = tan½𝛼,

and

𝛼 = _π_ - _θ_.

Then the area of the middle cut is

¼ _πr²_ = ½ _hb_ = ¼ _b²_ cot½𝛼.

So the ratio of the middle bar to the radius is

_b/r_ = √(_π_ tan½(_π_ - _θ_))

where

_θ_ - sin _θ_ = ¼ _π_, or _θ_ ≈ 1.76634,

so

_b/r_ ≈ 1.60635.
