==========================
Let 8 a.m. = 0 and 9 a.m. = 1.

Let the join time of person _i_ be _j<sub>i</sub>_ and the leave time
be _l<sub>i</sub>_, where _j<sub>i</sub>_ < _l<sub>i</sub>_.

The probability that any given person is not on the call with person _i_
is the probability that both random times are before _j<sub>i</sub>_ or both
random times are after _l<sub>i</sub>_, which is

_j<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> + (1 - l<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup>_.

So the probability that a given person is on the call with person _i_ is

_2l<sub>i</sub> - l<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> - j<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>_.

If there are _n_ other people, the probability that person _i_ is on the
call with all of them is

_(2l<sub>i</sub> - l<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> - j<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>n</sup>_.

Integrating _l_ from _j_ to 1 and then integrating _j_ from 0 to 1 gives
the probability that a given person is on the call with everyone else, which
is something more involved than I want to do, so call the result
_P<sub>n</sub>_.

The probability that none of the _n_ is on the call with everyone else is
_(1 - P<sub>n</sub>)<sup>n</sup>_.

So the probability that at least one person is on the call with everyone
else is _1 - (1 - P<sub>n</sub>)<sup>n</sup>_.
