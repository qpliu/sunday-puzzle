==========================
I think the minimum number points that the 8 edge points of 3Ã—3 grid can
be closer to one of than the middle point can be to any of is 3.

One corner and its two adjacent side points would be closest to a point
at or near the corner.

The opposite corner would be equidistant to points that are near its
adjacent side points.  The other corners would be nearest to those
respective points.  Those points would be outside of the grid to be
farther from the central point.

A rough picture:
```
   K 
    l     l     l


    l     C     l  K


    l     l     l

          K
```
