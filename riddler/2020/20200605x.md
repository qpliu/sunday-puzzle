==========================
On a planet with a near-circular orbit, looking straight up at sunset,
the sightline is approximately tangent to the orbit, so anything in
that sightline would have to be farther from the sun than the planet.

So, on a planet 1.5×10<sup>11</sup>m from the sun, seeing something
on an orbit 0.5×10<sup>11</sup>m or 1.5×10<sup>11</sup>m from the sun on
such a sightline makes less sense than seeing something orbiting
3×10<sup>11</sup>m from the sun.
