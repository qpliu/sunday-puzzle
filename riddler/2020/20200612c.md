==========================
Assume that each bacterium has the same lifespan as all bacteria in its
generation so that all bacteria of a generation are alive at the same time,
though that doesn't really matter.

If there are _n_ bacteria in a generation, the probability that there
are _m_ bacteria in the next generation, where _m_ must be even, is

![p_{n,m} = \binom{n}{m/2}p^{n-m/2}(1-p)^{m/2}](20200612c-1.svg)

The probability that a colony of _n_ bacteria dies this generation is

![d_n = (1-p)^n](20200612c-2.svg)

The probability that a colony of _n_ bacteria dies is
![D_n = \sum_{k=0}^n D_{2k}p_{n,2k}](20200612c-3.svg)

So the probability that the colony lives forever is
![1 - \sum_{k=0}^n D_{2k}p_{n,2k}](20200612c-4.svg)
