==========================
The chance of rolling 7 on a pair of standard dice is 6/36.  The chance of
rolling 11 on a pair of standard dice is 2/36.  So the chance of either
is 8/36 = 2/9.

When using the bowling technique, to maximize rolling 7 or 11, eliminate
the 3/4 pip sides, since they have no chance at rolling 11.  Then, the
chance of rolling 7 is 4/16, and the change of rolling 11 is 2/16, so
the chance of winning is 6/16 = 3/8.

If rolling 7 or 11 scores +1 and rolling 2, 3, or 12 scores -1, then, with
standard dice, the expected score is
6/36 + 2/36 - 1/36 - 2/36 - 1/36 = 4/36 = 1/9.

When using the bowling technique:
* Consider eliminating the 1/6 pip sides for the first roll, which
  means rolling 2 or 12 is impossible.
** If the first roll is 3/4, and rolling 2 or 11 is impossible, and the
   chance of rolling 7 is 1/4 whether the second roll eliminates 1/6 or 2/5.
** If the first roll is 2, the chance of rolling 7 is 1/4 and there is no
   chance of rolling 11, so the second roll should eliminate 1/6 to avoid
   rolling 3.
** If the first roll is 5, the chance of rolling 7 is 1/4 and there is no
   chance of rolling 3,  so the second roll should eliminate 3/4, giving a
   1/4 chance of rolling 11.
** The expected score would be 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 5/16.
* Consider eliminating 2/5 for the first roll
** If the first roll is 3/4, the chance of rolling 7 is 1/4.
** If the first roll is 1, eliminate 2/5 from the second roll to avoid 3,
   the chance of 7 is 1/4, the chance of 2 is 1/4.
** If the first roll is 6, eliminate 3/4, the chance of 7 is 1/4 and the
   chance of 11 is 1/4.
** The expected score would be 1/8 + 1/16 - 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 1/4.
* Consider eliminating 3/4 from the first roll.
** If the first roll is 1, eliminate 2/5 from the second roll,
   1/4 chance of 7, 1/4 chance of 2.
** If the first roll is 2, eliminate 1/6 from the second roll,
   1/4 chance of 7.
** If the first roll is 5 or 6, eliminate 3/4 from the second roll,
   1/4 chance of 7, 1/4 chance of 11.
** The expected score would be 1/16 - 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 5/16.
