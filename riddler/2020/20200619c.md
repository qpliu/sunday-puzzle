==========================
The trivial (and uninteresting) answer would be zero.

What we have is a set of perfect cubes, and the question is whether
they can be grouped in to three (or _n_) subsets that sum to the same
value.

One useful filter is that the sum of the cubes in the set
must be a multiple of three (or _n_).

Another filter is that the largest cube in the set must be less than
or equal to one third (or _1/n_) the sum of all the cubes in the set.

Using [code](202000619c.hs) to search for possible divisions:

|children|spheres|
|--------|-------|
|2       |12     |
|3       |23     |
|4       |24     |
|5       |24     |
|6       |35     |
|7       |41     |
|8       |47     |

The search algorithm I used very quickly becomes very slow for larger numbers
of children.
