==========================
Picking one dot, there are 10 distinct possible vertices.  Maybe some
of them are not possible due to intersecting sides, but I'll ignore that
and just come up with an incomplete answer.

Picking one of the adjacent vertices, there are 3 distinct possibilities,
and the one adjacent to that has 2 distinct possibilities.

So there are 60 possibilities, neglecting to consider whether some of
them are impossible due it being geometrically impossible to avoid
intersecting sides.

Similarly for seven dots, the first dot has 14 distinct possible vertices,
the second has 4, the third has 3, and the fourth has two, making 336
possibilities.
