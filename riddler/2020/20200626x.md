==========================
After two intersections, there is a 50% chance of heading north and 50%
chance of heading south.  So, after two more, two more, two more, and two
more intersections, the chance of heading north is 50% and the chance of
heading south is 50%.

Extra credit:

After one intersection, there is a 2/3 chance of heading east or west,
and 1/3 chance of heading north.

After two intersections, there is a 2/9+2/9=4/9 chance of heading east
or west, a 2/9 chance of heading south, and 2/9+1/9=3/9 chance of
heading north.

After ten intersections, the chance of heading north is 14763/59049, or approximately 25%.

Conjecture: as the number of intersections approaches infinity, the chance of heading in any of the four directions approaches 1/4.
