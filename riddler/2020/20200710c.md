==========================
There are 65 unique stacks:
* One ring stacks: 5
* Two ring stacks: 16
  * If any but the smallest ring is on the bottom: 4
* Three ring stacks: 27
  * If the largest ring is on the bottom: 9
    * If any but the smallest ring is second from the bottom: 3
  * If second largest ring is on the bottom: 9
    * If any but the smallest ring is second from the bottom: 3
  * If the third largest ring is on the bottom: 9
    * If any but the smallest ring is second from the bottom: 3
* Four ring stacks: 16
  * If the largest ring is on the bottom: 8
    * If the second largest ring is second from the bottom: 4
      * If any but the smallest ring is third from the bottom: 2
    * If the third largest ring is second from the bottom: 4
      * If any but the smallest ring is third from the bottom: 2
  * If the second largest ring is on the bottom: 8
    * If the largest ring is second from the bottom: 4
      * If any but the smallest ring is third from the bottom: 2
    * If the third largest ring is second from the bottom: 4
      * If any but the smallest ring is third from the bottom: 2
* Five ring stacks: 1

Let _S(N,M)_ be the number of unique stacks given _N_ positions on the
column plus _M_ rings that are bigger than the bottom position.

So:

_S(0,M) = 1_

Also:

_S(5,0) = 66_

If one of the _M_ bigger rings are on the bottom, there are _MS(N-1,M)_
unique stacks.

Otherwise, if the _ith_ ring is on the bottom, there are _S(i-1,M+N-i)_
unique stacks.

Plus, not adding any rings is one more.
