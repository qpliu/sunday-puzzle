==========================
I assume that all the electoral votes of each shire are allocated to the
winner of the popular vote for the shire.

There are 75 total electoral votes, so the winner needs to win 38 electoral
votes, which could come from Oneshire, Threeshire, Fourshire, Fiveshire,
Sixshire, and Sevenshire.  And winning each of those by one vote takes 136
popular votes, which is 24.3% of the 560 voters.
