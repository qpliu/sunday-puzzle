==========================
If you can tell that your opponent will play either rock or paper, play
paper and you'll either win or tie.

If you can tell that your opponent will play either paper or scissors, play
scissors and you'll either win or tie.

If you can tell that your opponent will play either rock or scissors, play
rock and you'll either win or tie.

So you'll eventually win, with an infinitesmal chance of tying forever.
