==========================
The linked article says nematodes are mostly self-fertilizing hermaphrodites
that cannot mate with other hermaphrodites, and 0.1-0.2% of nematodes are
males.  And hermaphrodites can mate with males.  I assume this does not apply
to the model.

I assume that when adding groups of _x_ and _y_ nematodes, it's
irrelevant whether pairings consist of two nematodes from group _x_, two
nematodes from group _y_, or one from each group.  I assume that in the
subsequent days, the offspring are added to the group and that there are never
any deaths.

|2,3 |1/2     |1          |

|6,7 |3/8     |2          |

So,
* 1/2 chance of 2 after one day
  * 1/4 chance of 2 after two days
    * 1/8 chance of 2 after three days
      * 1/16 chance of 2 after four days
      * 1/16 chance of 3 after four days
    * 1/8 chance of 3 after three days
      * 1/16 chance of 3 after four days
      * 1/16 chance of 4 after four days
  * 1/4 chance of 3 after two days
    * 1/8 chance of 3 after three days
      * 1/16 chance of 3 after four days
      * 1/16 chance of 4 after four days
    * 1/8 chance of 4 after three days
      * 1/32 chance of 4 after four days
      * 1/16 chance of 5 after four days
      * 1/32 chance of 6 after four days
* 1/2 chance of 3 after one day
  * 1/4 chance of 3 after two days
    * 1/8 chance of 3 after three days
      * 1/16 chance of 3 after four days
      * 1/16 chance of 4 after four days
    * 1/8 chance of 4 after three days
      * 1/32 chance of 4 after four days
      * 1/16 chance of 5 after four days
      * 1/32 chance of 6 after four days
  * 1/4 chance of 4 after two days
    * 1/16 chance of 4 after three days
      * 1/64 chance of 4 after four days
      * 1/32 chance of 5 after four days
      * 1/64 chance of 6 after four days
    * 1/8 chance of 5 after three days
      * 1/32 chance of 5 after four days
      * 1/16 chance of 6 after four days
      * 1/32 chance of 7 after four days
    * 1/16 chance of 6 after three days
      * 1/128 chance of 6 after four days
      * 3/128 chance of 7 after four days
      * 3/128 chance of 8 after four days
      * 1/128 chance of 9 after four days

So the expected value is
2/16 + 3/16 +
3/16 + 4/16 +
3/16 + 4/16 +
4/32 + 5/16 + 6/32 +
3/16 + 4/16 +
4/32 + 5/16 + 6/32 +
4/64 + 5/32 + 6/64 +
5/32 + 6/16 + 7/32 +
6/128 + 21/128 + 21/128 + 9/128 = 561/128 = 4.3828125.

The expected value of _2^N_ is 1/2 the expected value of _2^(N-1)_ plus
1/2 the expected value of _3^(N-1)_.  And the expected value of _3^N_ is 1/2
the expected value of _3^(N-1)_ plus 1/2 the expected value of _4^(N-1)_.
And the expected value of _4^N_ is more than twice the expected value of _2^N_,
since if there is an odd one out of each subgroup, they can pair with each
other.  I don't know how to continue this line of reasoning.

If there are _P_ pairs in a generation, i.e. there are _2P_ or _2P+1_
nematodes, then the chances of _Q_ offspring is _C(P,Q)/2^P_.  I don't know
how to continue this.
