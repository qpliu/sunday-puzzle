==========================
All points on the trail on the rectangular island are 1 mile from 2 points
on the shore, except the two ends, which are 1 mile from 3 points on the
shore, so the trail is 1 mile long.

The trail on the elliptical island is along the major axis.  In this case,
the ends of the trail both have only one nearest point.

Choose a coordinate system so that the shoreline satisfies, _4x² + 9y² = 9_.

At a point _x = t_ on the major axis, the square of the distance of to that
point is _d² = (x - t)² + y²_.

For points on the shoreline, _d² = (x - t)² + 1 - 4x²/9_.

For extrema, _0 = 2(x-t) - 8x/9_ or _5x/9 = t_.

So the ends of the trail are at _t = 5/6, -5/6_, and the trail is 1 2/3
miles long.
