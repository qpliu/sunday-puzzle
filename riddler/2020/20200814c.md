==========================
In 1/4 of the cases, all three cuts are on the same half.

In 3/4 of the cases two cuts are on one side of the 6-inch mark and
the other is on the other side.

So, on pieces with the 6-inch mark, on each side of the 6-inch mark, there
were 0, 1, 2, or 3 cuts.

If there were 0 cuts, the expected length of that side is 6 inches.

If there were 1 cut, the expected length of that side is 3 inches.

If there were 2 cuts, the expected length of that side is
_\int_0^6\int_0^6min(x,y) dx dy/36 = 2_.

If there were 3 cuts, the expected length of that side is
_\int_0^6\int_0^6\int_0^6min(x,y,z) dx dy dz/216 = 3/2_.

So in 1/4 of the cases, the expected length is 6 + 3/2 = 7 1/2 inches.

In 3/4 of the cases, the expected length is 3 + 2 = 5 inches.

Put together, that's 45/8 inches = 5 5/8 inches.
