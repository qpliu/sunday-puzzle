==========================
Orient the blue square to be rotated 45 degrees from the white squares.

The top corner can be overlapped by 2 white squares.  The bottom corner
can be overlapped by 2 white squares.

In the strip between the top 2 white squares and the bottom 2 white squares,
the blue square can be overlapped by 3 white squares.

So the blue square can be overlapped by up to 7 non-overlapping white squares.

[The real answer turns out to be 8.]
