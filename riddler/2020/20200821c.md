Given n posts that weigh k, the area of a regular n-sided polygon is
(1-nk)^2/(4n tan(pi/n)).

The minimum k for which using n posts maximizes the area of the polygon
is when the area is the same as using n+1 posts:
(1-nk)^2/(4n tan(pi/n)) = (1-(n+1)k)^2/(4(n+1) tan(pi/(n+1)))

Let F = (4(n+1) tan(pi/(n+1)))/(4n tan(pi/n)).

F(1 - 2nk + n^2k^2) = 1 - 2(n+1)k + (n+1)^2k^2.

((1-F)n^2 + 2n + 1)k^2 - ((1-F)2n + 2)k + (1-F) = 0.

Let G = 1-F

k = ((2Gn + 2) +- sqrt(4G^2n^2 + 8Gn + 4 - 4G^2n^2 - 8Gn - 4G))/(2Gn^2 + 4n + 2)

k = (Gn + 1 +- sqrt(1-G)) / (Gn^2 + 2n + 1)

For a given n, as k increases, the area hits a minimum of 0 when
1-nk = 0, then increases as the perimeter gets increasingly negative,
so the larger root must correspond to a negative perimeter for the
n+1 sided polygon.  So, take the smaller root.

k = (Gn + 1 - sqrt(1-G)) / (Gn^2 + 2n + 1)

As n gets large, G scales as 1/n^2, so k ~ G/2 ~ 1/n^2.
(Note that for the negative perimeter transitions, k ~ 1/n for large n.)

So, with [code](20200522c.hs) to calculate the minimum k for a given n,
which is the maximum k for n+1,
|n |maximum k|
