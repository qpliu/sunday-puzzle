==========================
If there were two independently random signals,
Signal 1 with probability P_1, and signal 2 with probability P_2.

Signal 1 would appear in P_1 of the samples.

Signal 2 would appear in P_2 of the samples.

Neither would appear in (1-P_1)(1-P_2) = 0.45 of the samples.

Both would appear in P_1P_2 = 0.17 of the samples.

1-P_1-P_2+P_1P2 = 0.45

1-P_1-P_2 = 0.28

P_1+P_2 = 0.72

P_1(0.72-P_1) = 0.17

P_1^2 - 0.72P_1 + 0.17 = 0

which does not have real roots, so it's not likely that the signal came
from two independently random fluctuations with fixed probabilities.
