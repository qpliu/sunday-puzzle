==========================
The probability that a deck is a 26-hand war deck is a calculation I don't
know a good way of doing.

The first card can be any card.

The second card has a 48/51 chance of being a different card.

The third card can be any remaining card.

The third card has a 6/50 chance of being the same as one of the first two
cards, in which case the fourth card has a 47/49 chance of being different
from the third card.

The third card has a 44/50 chance of being something different, in which case
the fourth card has a 46/49 chance of being different from the third card.

The fifth card has some chance of having 3 matching cards remaining in the
deck, and some chance of having 2 matching cards remaining in the deck,
and some chance of having 1 matching card remaining in the deck, and in
each of those cases, the sixth card has some chance of being different
from the fifth card.

To continue in this vein, the calculation quickly becomes unwieldy.

But it should result in some number, p, the probability that a randomly
shuffled deck is a 26-hand war deck.

Then find n where (1-p)^n < 0.5.  That should be when n > log 0.5/log(1-p).
