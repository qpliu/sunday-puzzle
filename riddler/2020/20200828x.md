==========================
The difference in the area of a sphere and a sphere with a slightly larger radius:
\delta A = 4\pi (r + \delta r)^2 - 4\pi r^2 = 8\pi r\delta r + 4\pi \delta r^2

We can neglect the \delta r^2 term.

When r = 6378 km and \delta r = 0.001 km,

\delta A \approx 160 km^2.

The area of Stockton, CA is approximately 160 km^2.
