The chance that 5 players come from at least one town is 1 - 4/5*4/5*4/5 = 61/125.

The chance that 4 players come from at least one town and no more than 4 players come from any town is 64/125 - 3/5*3/5*3/5 = 37/125.

The chance that 3 players come from at least one town and no more than 3 players come from any town is 27/125 - 2/5*2/5*2/5 = 19/125.

The chance that 2 players come from at least one town and no more than 2 players come from any town is 8/125 - 1/5*1/5*1/5 = 7/125.

The remaining 1/125 chance is one player from each town.

If the one-town team has 5 players, then the chance of forming the two-town team is 1/5*1/5 + 1/5*1/5 + 1/5*1/5 + 1/5*1/5 + 1/5*0 = 4/25, so the chance of forming 2 5-player teams is 244/3125.

If the one-town team has 4 players, then the chance of forming the two-town team is 1/4*1/4 + 1/4*1/4 + 1/4*1/4 + 1/4*0 = 3/16, so the chance of forming 2 4-player teams is 111/2000.

If the one-town team has 3 players, then the chance of forming the two-town team is 1/3*1/3 + 1/3*1/3 + 1/3*0 = 2/9, so the chance of forming 2 3-player teams is 38/1125.

If the one-town team has 2 players, then the chance of forming the two-town team is 1/2*1/2 + 1/2*0 = 1/4, so the chance of forming 2 2-player teams is 7/500.

These chances add up to 81611/450000, or about 0.1813578.

In the generalization, if there are from 1 to N players from each town, then the chance that the town with the most players has M players is (3M^2 - 3M + 1)/N^3.  Then, the chance that the number of players from the two remaining towns adds up to M is (M-1)/M^2, so the chance of having two M player teams is \frac{3M^3 - 6M^2 + 4M - 1}{M^2N^3}.

These chances add up to \sum_{M=1}^N\frac{3M^3 - 6M^2 + 4M - 1}{M^2N^3}.

Using:

\sum_{M=1}^N M = N(N+1)/2

\sum_{M=1}^N 1 = N

\sum_{M=1}^N 1/M = H_N

\sum_{M=1}^N 1/M^2 = ?

The chances are 3/2N + 3/2N^2 - 6/N^3 + 4H_N/N^3 - ?/N^3.

So for large N, that's approximately 3/2N.
