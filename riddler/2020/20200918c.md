Doing a binary search:

On the first guess:
* 1/267751 chance of guessing the secret word
* 267750/267751 chance of needing more guesses out of 133875

On the 267750/267751 chance of the second guess:
* 1/133875 chance of guessing the secret word
* 133874/133875 chance of needing more guesses out of 66937

On the 267750/267751×133874/133875 chance of the third guess:
* 1/66937 chance of guessing the secret word
* 66936/66937 chance of needing more guesses out of 33468

On the 267750/267751×133874/133875×66936/66937 chance of the fourth guess:
* 1/33468 chance of guessing the secret word
* 16734/33468 chance of needing more guesses out of 16734
* 16733/33468 chance of needing more guesses out of 16733

On the 267750/267751×133874/133875×66936/66937×16734/33468 chance of the fifth guess out of 16734:
* 1/16734 chance of guessing the secret word
* 8367/16734 chance of needing more guesses out of 8367
* 8366/16734 chance of needing more guesses out of 8366

On the 267750/267751×133874/133875×66936/66937×16733/33468 chance of the fifth guess out of 16733:
* 1/16733 chance of guessing the secret word
* 16732/16733 chance of needing more guesses out of 8366

On the 267750/267751×133874/133875×66936/66937×16734/33468×8367/16734 chance of the sixth guess out of 8367:
* 1/8367 chance of guessing the secret word
* 8366/8367 chance of needing more guesses out of 4183

On the 267750/267751×133874/133875×66936/66937×16734/33468×(8366/16734 + 16732/16733) chance of the sixth guess out of 8366:
* 1/8366 chance of guessing the secret word
* 4183/8366 chance of needing more guesses out of 4183
* 4182/8366 chance of needing more guesses out of 4182

On the 267750/267751×133874/133875×66936/66937×16734/33468×(8367/16734×8366/8367 + (8366/16734 + 16732/16733)×4183/8366) chance of the seventh guess out of 4183:
* 1/4183 chance of guessing the secret word
* 4182/4183 chance of needing more guesses out of 2091

On the 267750/267751×133874/133875×66936/66937×16734/33468×(8366/16734 + 16732/16733)×4182/8366 chance of the seventh guess out of 4182:
* 1/4182 chance of guessing the secret word
* 2091/4182 chance of needing more guesses out of 2091
* 2090/4182 chance of needing more guesses out of 2090

And so on...

Using [code](20200918c.hs) to complete the calculation, the expected number
of guesses is 4563001/267751, or about 17.04.

Note that log_2 267751 is about 18.03, so the maximum number of guesses for
a binary search is 20.
