==========================
12 = 2×2×3

Can balance two at 1-7, 2-8, 3-9, 4-10, 5-11, or 6-12.

Can balance three at 1-5-9, 2-6-10, 3-7-11, or 4-8-12.

One way to balance seven is 1-5-9 + 2-8 + 4-10.

Enumerating one fourth of the ways to balance seven:
* 1-5-9 + 2-8 + 4-10
* 1-5-9 + 2-8 + 6-12
* 1-5-9 + 4-10 + 6-12

So there are twelve arrangements that balance seven samples.
