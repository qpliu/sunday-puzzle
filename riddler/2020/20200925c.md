==========================
A lower limit, slicing the pizza into infinite little pieces, is a plate with
a 10/\sqrt2 inch diameter.

For a single cut, it seems to me the answer involves rotating one of the pieces
so that the newly cut edge of one piece abuts the straight diametric edge
of the initial semicircle of the other piece.

The cut also needs to intersect the diametric edge, otherwise it would still
need a 10 inch plate.

So there are 3 parameters: where to start the cut along the diametric edge,
the angle of the cut, and finally, where to join the two pieces, which is a
matter of sliding the pieces parallel to the join line to minimize the
circumscribing circle.

That's as far as I got before giving up.
