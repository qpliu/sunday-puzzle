==========================
Using [code](20201002c.hs), the answer is 1/2.

Calculating with different numbers of chocolates, the answer was always 1/2.

If there were m milk chocolate and d dark chocolates, where m > 0 and d > 0,
it seems the calculation always gives 1/2.

In any case, at some point, there is one of one type, and the last chocolate
eaten was that type and there are n of the other type, where n > 1.

At this point, there is a 1 in n+1 chance that the last chocolate is the
other type and and a n in n+1 chance that it becomes what I'll call scenario
A with n-1 of the other type.

In scenario A, there is 1 of one type and n of the other type, and there is a
1 in n+1 chance that the last chocolate is the other type, and a n in n+1
chance that it becomes scenario B with n-1 of the other type.

In scenario B, there is 1 of one type and n of the other type, and there is a
1 in n+1 chance that it becomes scenario A with n of the other type, and
a n in n+1 chance that it becomes scenario B with n-1 of the other type.

I'm not seeing how this reasoning will lead to understanding why the answer
is 1/2.
