==========================
For a number, c, to be a difference of squares, c = a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b).

So if c can be factored into a product of two numbers, c = fg, then
let a+b = f and a-b = g and the solutions for a and b are whole numbers,
then c is hip.

So a = (f+g)/2 and b = (f-g)/2.

So if f and g are both even or both odd, c is hip.

So c needs zero or at least two factors of 2 to be hip.

42 = 2×3×7 has one factor of 2, so 42 cannot be hip.

40 = 2×2×2×5 can be doubly hip as 40 = 4×10 and 40 = 2×20.

1440 = 2×2×2×2×2×3×3×5.

1440 cannot be a product of 2 odd numbers, so the answer is the number of
ways 1440 is a product of 2 even numbers:
* 2×2×2×2 × 2×3×3×5 = 16×90
* 2×2×2 × 2×2×3×3×5 = 8×180
* 2×2 × 2×2×2×3×3×5 = 4×360
* 2 × 2×2×2×2×3×3×5 = 2×720
* 2×2×2×2×3 × 2×3×5 = 48×30
* 2×2×2×3 × 2×2×3×5 = 24×60
* 2×2×3 × 2×2×2×3×5 = 12×120
* 2×3 × 2×2×2×2×3×5 = 6×240
* 2×2×2×2×3×3 × 2×5 = 144×10
* 2×2×2×3×3 × 2×2×5 = 72×20
* 2×2×3×3 × 2×2×2×5 = 36×40
* 2×3×3 × 2×2×2×2×5 = 18×80

So 1440 is 12-fold hip.  So hip=120.

Oops: The puzzler was for 1400, not 1440, but the reasoning stands.
