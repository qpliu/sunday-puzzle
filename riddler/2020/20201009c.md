==========================
If the front wheels can turn 30 degrees and the rear wheels cannot turn,
the front wheels will follow a large circle, and the rear wheels will
follow a smaller concentric circle.  Since the second case in which the
rear wheels can turn is easier, I'll do that first.

If the front wheels can turn 30 degrees and the rear wheels can turn 30
degrees, the wheels can follow the same circle.  The truck is on a chord
of length L of the circle, and the radii are 60 degrees from the chord,
so the chord is a 60 degree chord, making the length of the radii L.
The center of the truck follows a circle with radius (\sqrt3)L/2.  The
outer turning radius is L, and the inner turning radius is (\sqrt3)L/2.

So in the first case looks a lot like the second case with a truck
with double the length.  The front wheels follow a circle with
a radius of 2L, and the rear wheels follow a circle with a radius of
L\sqrt3.  The center of the truck follows a circle with a radius of
\sqrt{13})L/2.  The outer turning radius is 2L, and the inner turning
radius is L\sqrt3.
