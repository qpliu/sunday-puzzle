==========================
Let S_1, S_2, and S_3 be the shares of the vote for each candidate.

The constraint that S_1+S_2+S_3=1 means

C\int_0^1\int_0^1\int_0^1 \delta(1-S_1-S_2-S_3) dS_1 dS_2 dS_3 = 1,

where \delta is the Dirac delta function.  Integrating over S_3,

C\int_0^1\int_0^1 H(1-S_1-S_2) dS_1 dS_2 = 1,

where H is the Heaviside step function.  Integrating over S_2,

C\int_0^1 (1-S_1) dS_1 = 1,

then integrating over S_1 gives the weight, C=2.

The probability that candidate 1 wins outright is

2\int_0^1\int_0^1\int_0^1 \delta(1-S_1-S_2-S_3)H(S_1-1/2) dS_1 dS_2 dS_3.

Integrating over S_3 and S_2 gives

2\int_0^1 (1-S_1) H(S_1-1/2) dS_1 = 2\int_{1/2}^1 (1-S_1) dS_1 = 1/4.

Symmetrically, 1/4 is the probability that each of the other candidates
wins outright, so the remaining 1/4 is the probability of a runoff.
