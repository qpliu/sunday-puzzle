==========================
If James has the shot, the chance is 1/2 that James wins, p/2 that James
gets the next shot, and (1-p)/2 that Davis gets the next shot.

If Davis has the shot, the chance is 1/2 that Davis wins, p/2 that James
gets the next shot, and (1-p)/2 that Davis gets the next shot.

Let J be the chance that LeBron wins if he has the first shot and D be
the chance that Davis wins if he has the first shot.

J = 1/2 + pJ/2 + (1-p)(1-D)/2

D = 1/2 + p(1-J)/2 + (1-p)D/2

If p=0, then J=1/2 and D=1.  If p=1, then J=1 and D=1/2.

Solving for J and D,

(1-p/2)J + (1-p)D/2 = 1-p/2

pJ + (1+p)D = 1+p

(1-p/2)(1+p)J = (1-p/2)(1+p) - (1+p)(1-p)/2

(1-p/2+p-p^2/2)J = 1-p/2+p-p^2/2 - 1/2 + p^2/2

(1+p/2-p^2/2)J = 1/2+p/2

J = (1+p)/(2+p-p^2), which checks out when p=0 and p=1

D = 1 - pJ/(1+p) = 1 - p/(2+p-p^2)

If J = D, then

(1+p)/(2+p-p^2) = 1 - p/(2+p-p^2)

Solving for p,

1+p = 2+p-p^2 - p = 2-p^2

p^2 + p - 1 = 0

The positive root is p = (\sqrt5-1)/2, or about 0.618, making J and D about
0.7236.

Note: this is wrong because if AD wins the coin flip, there is a p chance that
LeBron steals the ball, but this calculation assumes that AD has a 100% chance
of taking the first shot.
