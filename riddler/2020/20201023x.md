Enumerating all the possible trials, each of which occur with equal
probability:
|shot 1|shot 2|shot 3|chance trial selected|chance selected shot made|
|make  |make  |make  |1/6                  |1                        |

|miss  |miss  |miss  |0                    |                         |

Adding up the chances of the selected shot having been made gives 5/12.

If her shooting percentage were p, then
|shot 1|shot 2|shot 3|fraction of trials|chance trial selected|chance selected shot made|
|make  |make  |make  |p^3               |p^3/s                |1   |
|make  |make  |miss  |p^2(1-p)          |p^2(1-p)/s           |1/2 |
|make  |miss  |make  |p^2(1-p)          |p^2(1-p)/s           |0   |
|make  |miss  |miss  |p(1-p)^2          |p(1-p)^2/s           |0   |
|miss  |make  |make  |p^2(1-p)          |p^2(1-p)/s           |1   |
|miss  |make  |miss  |p(1-p)^2          |p(1-p)^2/s           |0   |
|miss  |miss  |make  |p(1-p)^2          |0                    |    |
|miss  |miss  |miss  |(1-p)^3           |0                    |    |

where s = p^3+3p^2(1-p)+2p(1-p)^2.

Adding up the chances gives (2p^3+p^2(1-p)+2p(1-p)^2)/2s.
