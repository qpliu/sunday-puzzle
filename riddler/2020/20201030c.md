2020-10-30 Riddler Classic
==========================
The first person eliminated said 19, 80, 141, ...

The second person eliminated said 32, 92, 152, ...

Zach said 1, 60, 119, ...

So

(N - 1) mod 61 = 18

(N - 1) mod 60 = 31

(N - 1) mod 59 = 0

Using [code](20201030c.hs), the smallest N is 136232.

Then, instead of thinking, let the computer brute force the extra credit.

The winner with N = 136232 is 58.

The smallest N for which 1 is the winner is 140.
