==========================
In the first run, p = 9 min/mile, v = 1/9 mile/min, and d = vT = 20 miles.
So T = 180 min or 3:00:00.

In the second run, p = 8 + 2t/T, v = 1/(8 + 2t/T), and
d = \int_0^T dt/(8 + 2t/T) = 20 miles.

d = (T/2)(ln(8+2T/T) - ln(8)) = (T/2)ln(10/8).

so T = 40/ln(5/4) min or about 179.257 or 2:59:15.41.
