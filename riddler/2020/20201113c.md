2020-11-13 Riddler Classic
==========================
When there are N remaining flips left and a team needs to win M flips to
win, the chance of winning is \sum_{i=M}^N C(N,i)/2^N.

If a team has won 50 flips, it needs at least 7 remaining flips to
have less than 1% chance (1/2^7 = 1/128) of losing.

Using [code](20201113c.hs), the earliest a team can get to at least 99%
chance of winning is after winning the first 21 flips.

Tabulating the number of flips needed to have won on each flip to have at least
99% chance of winning

So the chance of the epic choke is
* the chance of winning 21 of the first 21 flips × 1/2 (the chance of winning the 22nd flip) × (1 - chance of winning from that point)
* plus (the chance of winning 22 of the first 23 flips - chance of winning 1 out of 2 flips × the chance of winning the 21 of the first 21) × 1/2 × (1 - chance of winning from that point)
* plus (the chance of winning 23 of the first 25 flips - chance of winning 2 out of 3 flips × the chance of winning 22 of the first 23) × 1/2 × (1 - chance of winning from that point)
* and so on

Note that a team cannot go from under 99% chance of winning to over 99% chance of winning on the 23rd, 25th, 27th, 30th, ... flips.

Doing the calculation, the chance is
1396430344927599027206153885/2535301200456458802993406410752
or about 0.05508%.
