==========================
The expected value of each clue is 29/30×clue value + 1/30×daily double value.

The daily double values are the maximum of 1000 and the current winnings in
the absence of the daily double.

The current winnings in the absence of the daily double are
|T    |R    |E    |B    |E    |K    |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|0    |200  |400  |600  |800  |1000 |
|1200 |1600 |2000 |2400 |2800 |3200 |
|3600 |4200 |4800 |5400 |6000 |6600 |
|7200 |8000 |8800 |9600 |10400|11200|
|12000|13000|14000|15000|16000|17000|

And the daily double values are
|T    |R    |E    |B    |E    |K    |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|1000 |1000 |1000 |1000 |1000 |1000 |
|1200 |1600 |2000 |2400 |2800 |3200 |
|3600 |4200 |4800 |5400 |6000 |6600 |
|7200 |8000 |8800 |9600 |10400|11200|
|12000|13000|14000|15000|16000|17000|

The $200 clues have an expected value of 6×29/30×$200+6×1/30×$1000 = $1360.

The $400 clues have an expected value of 6×29/30×$400+1/30×($1200+$1600+$2000+$2400+$2800+$3200) = $2760.

The $600 clues have an expected value of 6×29/30×$600+1/30×($3600+$4200+$4800+$5400+$6000+$6600) = $4500.

The $800 clues have an expected value of 6×29/30×$800+1/30×($7200+$8000+$8800+$9600+$10400+$11200) = $6480.

The $1000 clues have an expected value of 6×29/30×$1000+1/30×($12000+$13000+$14000+$15000+$16000+$17000) = $8700.

Adding them up gives $23800.

When randomly selecting clues, the expected value of each clue is
29/30×clue value + 1/30×expected daily double value.

There are 5 expected daily double values, one for each clue value.

The daily double can be any selection from the 1st to the 30th, and
brute forcing the 29! combinations isn't feasible, but since there are
only 5 different clue values, there should be some combinatorics that
could be done.
