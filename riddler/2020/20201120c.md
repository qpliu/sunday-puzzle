==========================
Due to left-right symmetry, I'd expect the last person to be the one directly
across from me.  But if it's not, then two people would be equally likely to be
the last.

The number of times someone is expected to pass the sauce should follow
a binomial distribution that wraps around such that 10 = -10 corresponding to
the person directly across from me.

Since I don't think the sum of the distribution and its wraparounds will
result in troughs other than the one the opposite of the peak, I'll guess
that the answer is the person directly opposite.
