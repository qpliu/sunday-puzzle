==========================
Due to left-right symmetry, I'd expect the last person to be the one directly
across from me.  But if it's not, then two people would be equally likely to be
the last.

The number of times someone is expected to pass the sauce should follow
a binomial distribution that wraps around such that 10 = -10 corresponding to
the person directly across from me.

Since I don't think the sum of the distribution and its wraparounds will
result in troughs other than the one the opposite of the peak, I'll guess
that the answer is the person directly opposite.

On second thought, here is a different hand-wavy result: the most likely
to be last are the 5th to the left or right.  When it's closer than 5 away
from me, it's more likely to come back to me before getting to the person
directly across from me.  When it's more than 5 away from me, it's more
likely to get to the person directly across from me than to get back to me.
So once it has gotten to the person directly across from me, considering those
on the opposite side of the path it took, it's more likely to have gotten to
those closer than 5 away from me and less likely to have gotten to those more
than 5 away from me.

If P(i,n) is the chance the sauce gets to and no further than i places away
in n passes, then... Make a symmetrical argument once it gets to the person
directly opposite from me...
