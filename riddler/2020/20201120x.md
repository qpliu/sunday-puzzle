==========================
There a number of cases to consider.
* One of the four years is a leap year
* None of the four years is a leap year
* One of the years is 1752

To get the last case out of the way,
|year|f13s|
|----|----|
|1749|2   |
|1750|2   |
|1751|2   |
|1752|2   |
|1753|2   |
|1754|2   |
|1755|1   |
The most Friday 13ths in four years including 1752 is 8.  And since none of
them had 3, there are probably other stretches of four years with more.

Tabulating the number of Friday 13ths in years by the day of week of January
1st,
|Jan 1|Non-leap year|Leap year|
|-----|-------------|---------|
|Mon  |2,Apr,Jul    |2,Sep,Dec|
|Tue  |2,Sep,Dec    |1,Jun    |
|Wed  |1,Jun        |2,Mar,Nov|
|Thu  |3,Feb,Mar,Nov|2,Feb,Aug|
|Fri  |1,Aug        |1,May    |
|Sat  |1,May        |1,Oct    |
|Sun  |2,Jan,Oct    |3,Jan,Apr,Jul|

After a non-leap year, Jan 1 advances one day of the week.  After
a leap year, Jan 1 advances two days of the week.

For 4 years with no leap years (the earliest of which is 1897-1900),
the most in 4 years is 8, for example 1900-1903.

Starting from a leap year with a Sunday Jan 1st, there are 9 Friday 13ths,
for example 2012-2015.

To consider non-calendar year 4-year periods, consider 5 calendar year
periods.

For 5 non-leap years, starting from a Sunday Jan 1, there are
10 Friday 13ths, for example 2197-2201.  But the first 2 are Jan 13 and Oct 13,
and the last 3 are Feb 13, Mar 13, and Nov 13, so the most is 8 in 4 years.

When including 2 leap years, the most in 5 years is 10, starting from a
Sunday Jan 1, for example 2012-2016.  But the first 3 are Jan 13, Apr 13,
and Jul 13, and the last is May 13, so the most in 4 years is still 9.

When including 1 leap year, the most in 5 years is 10, starting with
3 non-leap years, and starting with Thursday Jan 1st, for example 2009-2013.
The first 3 are Feb 13, Mar 13, Nov 13.  The last 2 are Sep 13, Dec 13,
so the most in 4 years is still 9.

So it looks like the most in a 4 year period is 9.
