==========================
My guess is to divide the angle of the smallest vertex by three.

If the angles of the dough triangle are \alpha, \beta, and \pi/2, where
\alpha \le \beta, then
the angles of the cookie cutter triangle are \alpha/3, \beta+2\alpha/3, and
\pi/2.

If the sides of the dough triangle are a, b, and c where a^2+b^2=c^2 and
a \ge b, then
the sides of the cookie cutter triangle are a, b', and c', where a^2+b'^2=c'^2.

Since tan\alpha = b/a and tan\alpha/3 = b'/a, so b' = a tan(arctan(b/a)/3).

The area of the dough triangle is ab/2, and the area of the cookie cutter
triangle is ab'/2 so the cookie percentage is
3ab'/ab or 3a tan(arctan(b/a)/3)/b, which approaches 1 as a/b approaches
infinity.

Now I notice that it's an isosceles triangle, so a = b, so the percentage
is 3 tan(\pi/12) or about 80.38%.  It's still only a guess at how to
maximize the cookie percentage and some other shape might do better.

The riddler doesn't say whether the cookie cutter can flipped over or if
a flipped over cookie could count as identical, but my guess doesn't require
any flipped over cookies.

If a flipped over cookies would count as identical, consider right triangles
with hypotenuse a and one vertex of \pi/8.  The remaining vertex would be
3\pi/8.  The length of the sides would be a sin\pi/8 and a cos\pi/8.
If two of these triangles bisect one dough vertex, the remaining dough would
be a triangle with sides a, 2a sin\pi/8, and (\sqrt2-1)a

Since a cos\pi/8 is greater than both (\sqrt2-1)a and 2a sin\pi/8, a third
cookie cannot be made.  But the cutter triangle could be cut down to the
size of the remaining dough, having vertices of \pi/8, \pi/4 and 5\pi/8
and sides a, 2a sin\pi/8, and (\sqrt2-1)a.  Then, the waste would be
a isosceles triangle with two sides (\sqrt2-1)a and one side 2a sin\pi/8.
The height is a\sqrt{(\sqrt2-1)^2 - sin^2\pi/8}, so the area of the waste
is a^2 sin(\pi/8)\sqrt{(\sqrt2-1)^2 - sin^2\pi/8} or about 0.06066a^2,
or about 12.13% of the dough, so the cookie percentage would be about 87.87%.
