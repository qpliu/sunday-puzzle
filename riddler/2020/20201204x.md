==========================
I assume that the question is for one round of drawing.

The first draw has 4/5 chance of not being a self-draw.

Then, the second draw has a 1/4 chance of having been drawn by the
first draw, in which case the chance of not being a self draw is 1,
and a 3/4 chance of having not been drawn by the first draw, in which
case the chance of not being a self-draw is 3/4.

Then, the third draw has a x chance of having been drawn by one of the
first two draws, but if it hadn't been, the chance of a self-draw is
1/3.

Then, the fourth draw has a y chance of having been drawn by one of the
first three draws, but if it hadn't been, the chance of a self-draw is
1/2.

Then, the fifth draw has a z chance of having been drawn by one of the
first four draws, but if it hadn't been, the chance of a self-draw is 1.

So the chance of not having a self-draw is 4/5 \times (x + (1-x) \times 3/4)
\times (y + (1-y) \times 2/3) \times z.

Now it's a matter of calculating x, y, and z.

But it would be easier to have [code](20201204x.hs) count the
permutations with self-draws filtered out divided by the count of
all the permutations, giving 44/120 or 36.7%.
