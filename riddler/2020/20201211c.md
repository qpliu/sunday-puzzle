==========================
Let A and B be the citizens in one row, and C, D, and E be the citizens
in the other row.

Let 1, 2, and 3 be a cyclic permutation of red, blue, and green, where
1 is A's color.

In the case that A and B have different colors, C and D guess A's color,
and E guesses the color of neither A or B.  If C and D have
different colors, and A guesses the color of neither C or D, then one of
A, C, or D will guess correctly.  If C and D have the same color, A and B
guess E's color, then one of A, B, or E will guess correctly.

The strategies for A and B (except for B's guess if C and D have different
colors) are set.

Enumerating the cases if A and B have the same color, which is 1:
* 111 - A and B guess 11 correctly
* 112 - A and B guess 22 incorrectly
* 113 - A and B guess 33 incorrectly
* 121 - A guesses 3 incorrectly
* 122 - A guesses 3 incorrectly
* 123 - A guesses 3 incorrectly
* 131 - A guesses 2 incorrectly
* 132 - A guesses 2 incorrectly
* 133 - A guesses 2 incorrectly
* 211 - A guesses 3 incorrectly
* 212 - A guesses 3 incorrectly
* 213 - A guesses 3 incorrectly
* 221 - A and B guess 11 correctly
* 222 - A and B guess 22 incorrectly
* 223 - A and B guess 33 incorrectly
* 231 - A guesses 1 correctly
* 232 - A guesses 1 correctly
* 233 - A guesses 1 correctly
* 311 - A guesses 2 incorrectly
* 312 - A guesses 2 incorrectly
* 313 - A guesses 2 incorrectly
* 321 - A guesses 1 correctly
* 322 - A guesses 1 correctly
* 323 - A guesses 1 correctly
* 331 - A and B guess 11 correctly
* 332 - A and B guess 22 incorrectly
* 333 - A and B guess 33 incorrectly

If C and D have different colors, B should guess differently than A.
To help E, B's guess should depend on E's color.  So if A's guess is
not E's color, B guesses E's color, otherwise B guesses the next color
in the cycle from E's color:
* 112 - A and B guess 22 incorrectly
* 113 - A and B guess 33 incorrectly
* 122 - A and B guess 32 incorrectly
* 132 - A and B guess 23 incorrectly
* 133 - A and B guess 23 incorrectly
* 212 - A and B guess 32 incorrectly
* 222 - A and B guess 22 incorrectly
* 223 - A and B guess 33 incorrectly
* 312 - A and B guess 23 incorrectly
* 313 - A and B guess 23 incorrectly
* 332 - A and B guess 22 incorrectly
* 333 - A and B guess 33 incorrectly

If E guesses 2:
* 113
* 133
* 223
* 313
* 333

If E guesses 3:
* 112
* 122
* 132
* 212
* 222
* 312
* 332

I don't see strategies for C and D that cover all the remaining cases.

I give up.
