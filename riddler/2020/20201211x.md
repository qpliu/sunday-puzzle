==========================
If reading the same forward and backward means it needs to be a palindrome,
there are 4 bits, or 16 nights.

If it just means being able to tell what night it is from either front or
back, 2 bits, with one on and one off, can be used to orient the left and
right, leaving 6 bits, giving 64 nights.  Plus, the 2 indicator bits could
be both on or both off, so add twice the nights a 6-candle menorah could
represent.

With 6 bits, use 2 bits as indicator bits, one on and one off, leaving
4 bits, giving 16 nights.  Plus, the 2 indicator bits could both be on or
both off, so add twice the nights a 4-candle menorah could represent.

With 4 bits, use 2 bits as indicator bits, one on and one off, leaving
2 bits, giving 4 nights.  Plus, the 2 indicator bits could both be on or
both off, so add twice what a 2-candle menorah could represent.

With 2 bits, 3 nights could be represented by both on, both off, or one
on and one off.

So with 4 candles, 10 nights could be represented.

So with 6 candles, 36 nights could be represented.

So with 8 candles, 136 nights could be represented.
