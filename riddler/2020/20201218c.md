==========================
If B starts with N points, A wins on the first turn.  That's a lower bound.

If B starts with 2N points, B wins on the second turn.  That's an upper bound.

Now, doing a binary search, assuming the power points can be rational numbers.

If B starts with 3N/2 points, then after the first two turns
N - 3N/2 → N - N/2 → N/2 - N/2, which reduces to B starting with N points,
making a new lower bound.

If B starts with 7N/4, then N - 7N/4 → N - 3N/4 → N/4 - 3N/4, which reduces
to B starting with more than the upper bound of 2N, making a new upper bound.

If B starts with 13N/8, then N - 13N/8 → N - 5N/8 → 3N/8 - 5N/8 → 3N/8 - N/4 →
N/8 - N/4, which reduces to B starting with 2N points, making a new upper
bound.

If B starts with 25N/16, then N - 25N/16 → N - 9N/16 → 7N/16 - 9N/16, which
reduces to B starting with less than the lower bound of 3N/2, making a new
lower bound.

If B starts with 51N/32, then N - 51N/32 → N - 19N/32 → 13N/32 → 19N/32,
which reduces to B starting with 19N/13, which is more than the upper bound
of 13N/8, making a new upper bound.

Using [code](20201218c.hs) to do more iterations, it looks like it converges
on the golden ratio, 1.618033988749895...

So, assuming the power points can be real numbers,
if B starts with \phi N, where \phi = 1 + 1/\phi,
then N - \phi N → N - N/\phi → (1 - 1/\phi) N - N/\phi, which reduces to
(\phi - 1) N - N, or N/\phi - N, which is where we started, except with
an exponential decay.

So, assuming the number of points must be a whole number, the answer is
the largest whole number less than \phi N.
