==========================
If r is the minimum radius at which the disk is balanced, then
1 - r^2/4R^2 is the probability that the disk is balanced.

To find r, find the chord connecting the intersection points of the disk
edge and the rim.  When the chord intersects the center of the disk, then
r is the distance from the center of the rim to the center of the disk.

So, the endpoints of the chord are R from the center of the disk
and 2R from the center of the rim.  That makes right triangles with
edges R, \sqrt3R and 2R, so r = \sqrt3R.

So the probability that the disk is balanced is 1 - r^2/4R^2 = 1/4.
