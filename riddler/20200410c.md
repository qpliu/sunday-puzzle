This process sounds like time-reversed radioactive decay, which
means exponential growth.

_T = p + s_
_dT/dt = kT_

where _s_ is the amount of spam, _t_ is time, _T_ is the amount of
spam targets, _k_ is a constant, and, assuming no legitimate comments,
_p = 1_ is the column.

_T = p + exp(kt) - 1_
_s = exp(kt) - 1_
_k = ln2_

So, after 3 days, _s = exp(3ln2) - 1 = 7_.

If there were legitimate comments, those would also drive spam,
which could be modeled by having _p_ vary with time.
