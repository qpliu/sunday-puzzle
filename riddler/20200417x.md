========================
Based on the board, only knights could have moved, and black must have made
an even number of moves.

Since the black queen was on a dark square, only the right white knight could
have moved there in an even number of moves.

So the left white knight must have made an odd number of moves to move to the
right white knight's initial position.

Using [code](20200417x.hs) that generates the possible paths, there are 2156
possible 8-move paths for right white knight to the black queen, and there
are 6 possible 5-move paths for the left white knight to the right white
knight's initial position.
