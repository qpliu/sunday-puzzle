==========================
The zero goat case is eliminated, eliminating ¼ of the possibilities.

Of the one goat cases, which together are ¼ of the possibilities, the ⅓
where the goat is behind the chosen door is eliminated.  In the remaining
⅔, switching makes no difference.

The two goat cases, which together are ¼ of the possibilities, are the
original problem, so in ⅓ of these possibilities, switching means losing
and in ⅔ of these possibilities, switching means winning.

In the three goat cases, which together are ¼ of the possibilities, switching
makes no difference.

So switching means the chance of winning is (¼×⅔+¼×⅔)/(¼×⅔+½), or ½.
Not switching means the chance of winning is (¼×⅔+¼×⅓)/(¼×⅔+½), or ⅜.

¼ of the time, there was one goat and switching would make no difference.
⅜ of the time, there were three goats and switching would make no difference.

If it had been the case that no other door could reveal a goat, the chance of
winning would have been ¼/(¼+¼×⅔), or ⅗.
