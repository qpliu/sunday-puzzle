==========================
Let the radius of the target be 1.

The probability distribution of the distance from the center of any given
arrow is p(r) = 2r.

Let s(r) be the expected additional score if the previous arrow
is r from the center.

s(r) = \int_0^r p(r')s(r')dr' + 1

Differentiating gives the differential equation

ds/dr = 2rs

with boundary condition s(0) = 1, which has the solution

s = e^{r^2}

So the expected score is s(1) = e \approx 2.71828
