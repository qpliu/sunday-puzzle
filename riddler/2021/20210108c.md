==========================
Let the radius of the target be 1.

The probability distribution of the distance from the center of any given
arrow is p(r) = 2r.

Let s(r) be the expected additional score if the previous arrow
is r from the center.

s(r) = \int_0^r p(r')s(r')dr' + 1

Differentiating gives the differential equation

ds/dr = 2rs

with boundary condition s(0) = 1, which has the solution

s = e^{r^2}

So the expected score is s(1) = e \approx 2.71828

When the target consists of 10 concentric circles, the probability distribution
is discrete, p_i = (i^2 - (i-1)^2)/100, where i = 1, 2, ... 10.

Let s_i be the expected additional score where i is the radius of the smallest
circle containing the previous arrow.

s_i = \sum_{i'=1}^{i-1} p_{i'}s_{i'} + 1

Calculating the expected score with [code](20210108c.hs) gives
s_{11} = 10234113997905495243/4000000000000000000 \approx 2.55853
