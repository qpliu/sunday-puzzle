==========================
If a square can be sliced into n squares, where n is any member of some set,
then it can be sliced into n-1+m squares, where n and m are members of the set.

A square cannot be sliced into 2, 3, or 5 squares.  It can be sliced into 4, 6,
or 8 squares.

A square can be sliced into 4 squares with 1/4 area.

A square can be sliced into 1 square with 4/9 area and 5 squares with 1/9 area.

A square can be sliced into 1 square with 9/16 area and 7 squares with 1/16
area.

So a square can be cut into 4+3n, 6+3n, 8+3n, 4+5n, 6+5n, 8+5n, 4+7n,
6+7n, or 8+7n squares, where n is a nonnegative integer.  Since it can be
cut into 6+3n, 7+3n, or 8+3n squares, it can be cut into any number greater
than 5 of squares.
