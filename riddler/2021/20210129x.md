==========================
An isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse length of 1 has edge length

An equilateral triangle can be divided into 3 isosceles triangles with
angles <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\pi/6">,
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\pi/6">, and
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2\pi/3">.
The long edge has length 1.  The short edges have length
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1/2cos(\pi/6) = 1/\sqrt3">, so the center of the triangle is
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1/\sqrt3">
from its vertices.

We have triangular pyramid with base edges of length 1 and apex edges of length<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1/\sqrt2">.

A right triangle formed by the center of the base, the apex, and one of its
base vertices has a hypotenuse with length
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1/\sqrt2">,
and sides with lengths
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1/\sqrt3"> and
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1/\sqrt6">.

So the bottommost corner of the cube on top is

or approximately 0.5918, above the ground.
