==========================
It's not clear whether solving means moving the discs to either of the
other poles or to a particular pole.  I assume it's moving to either of
the other poles since that makes the solution more tractable.

When all the discs are on the same pole, there are 2 valid moves.

When there are discs on two or three poles, there are 3 valid moves:
* move the smallest onto the largest/empty
* move the middle onto the largest/empty
* move the middle onto the smallest

For the positions with 3 valid moves, there is a 1/3 chance of moving to
each of 3 other positions, so the average number of moves to solve
from that position would be 1+1/3×(sum of the average number of moves to
solve from the 3 other positions).

So, from the start position, it is 1+1/2×(sum of the average number of moves
to solve from the 2 accessible positions (which should be equal)).

For the end positions, it is 0.

This makes a set of linear equations, or a big sparse matrix.

For the 3-disc case, the equations are
```
m_{,,123} = 0
m_{,1,23} - m_{,,123}/3 - m_{1,,23}/3 - m_{2,1,3}/3 = 1
m_{,2,13} - m_{,12,3}/3 - m_{1,2,3}/3 - m_{2,,13}/3 = 1
m_{,12,3} - m_{,2,13}/3 - m_{1,2,3}/3 - m_{3,12,}/3 = 1
m_{,3,12} - m_{,13,2}/3 - m_{1,3,2}/3 - m_{3,,12}/3 = 1
m_{,13,2} - m_{,3,12}/3 - m_{1,3,2}/3 - m_{2,13,}/3 = 1
m_{,23,1} - m_{,123,}/3 - m_{1,23,}/3 - m_{2,3,1}/3 = 1
m_{,123,} = 0

m_{1,3,2} - m_{,13,2}/3 - m_{,3,12}/3 - m_{1,23,}/3 = 1
m_{1,23,} - m_{,123,}/3 - m_{,23,1}/3 - m_{1,3,2}/3 = 1
m_{2,,13} - m_{,2,13}/3 - m_{12,,3}/3 - m_{2,1,3}/3 = 1

m_{12,,3} - m_{12,3,}/3 - m_{2,,13}/3 - m_{2,1,3}/3 = 1
m_{12,3,} - m_{12,,3}/3 - m_{2,13,}/3 - m_{2,3,1}/3 = 1
m_{3,,12} - m_{,3,12}/3 - m_{13,,2}/3 - m_{3,1,2}/3 = 1
m_{3,1,2} - m_{13,,2}/3 - m_{23,1,}/3 - m_{3,,12}/3 = 1
m_{3,2,1} - m_{13,2,}/3 - m_{23,,1}/3 - m_{3,12,}/3 = 1

m_{13,,2} - m_{13,2,}/3 - m_{3,,12}/3 - m_{3,1,2}/3 = 1
m_{13,2,} - m_{13,,2}/3 - m_{3,12,}/3 - m_{3,2,1}/3 = 1
m_{23,,1} - m_{123,,}/3 - m_{23,1,}/3 - m_{3,2,1}/3 = 1
m_{23,1,} - m_{123,,}/3 - m_{23,,1}/3 - m_{3,1,2}/3 = 1
m_{123,,} - m_{23,,1}/2 - m_{23,1,}/2 = 1
```
Due to symmetry when moving to either of the other poles is a solution,
m_{x,y,z} = m_{x,z,y}.
```
m_{,2,13} - m_{,3,12}/3 - m_{1,3,2}/3 - m_{2,13,}/3 = 1
m_{,3,12} - m_{,2,13}/3 - m_{1,3,2}/3 - m_{3,12,}/3 = 1
m_{,23,1} - m_{,123,}/3 - m_{1,23,}/3 - m_{2,3,1}/3 = 1
m_{,123,} = 0
m_{1,3,2} - m_{,2,13}/3 - m_{,3,12}/3 - m_{1,23,}/3 = 1
m_{1,23,} - m_{,123,}/3 - m_{,23,1}/3 - m_{1,3,2}/3 = 1
m_{2,3,1} - m_{,23,1}/3 - m_{12,3,}/3 - m_{2,13,}/3 = 1
m_{2,13,} - m_{,2,13}/3 - m_{12,3,}/3 - m_{2,3,1}/3 = 1
m_{12,3,} - m_{12,3,}/3 - m_{2,13,}/3 - m_{2,3,1}/3 = 1
m_{3,2,1} - m_{13,2,}/3 - m_{23,1,}/3 - m_{3,12,}/3 = 1
m_{3,12,} - m_{,3,12}/3 - m_{13,2,}/3 - m_{3,2,1}/3 = 1
m_{13,2,} - m_{13,2,}/3 - m_{3,12,}/3 - m_{3,2,1}/3 = 1
m_{23,1,} - m_{123,,}/3 - m_{23,1,}/3 - m_{3,2,1}/3 = 1
m_{123,,} - m_{23,1,}/2 - m_{23,1,}/2 = 1
```

I could solve this by hand, but my attempt was too error-prone, so
I'll write code to do it.  Rather than download and install some linear
algebra package, I'll just do a simple-minded upper-triangularization,
which ought to give the answer if I make sure the start state is the
right-most column.

The [code](20210205c.hs) gives 637/9, or about 70.78, moves for the
3-disc case.

For the 4-disc case, it's 10880/27, or about 402.96, moves.

For the 5-disc case, it's 174361/81, or about 2152.60, moves.

For the 6-disc case, it's 2711072/243, or about 11156.67, moves.

For 3-discs and 4 poles, it's 23947/360, or about 66.52, moves.

Now consider the case where the solution is a particular pole rather than any
pole other than the start pole.  Let m_a be the average number of moves to
any pole, and m_p be the average number of moves to a particular pole.

In the 3-pole case, 1/2 of the time m_a moves solves it, and 1/2 the time
m_a moves another m_p moves is needed, or m_p = m_a/2 + (m_a + m_p)/2,
so m_p = 2m_a.

In the 4-pole case, m_p = m_a/3 + 2(m_a + m_p)/3, or m_p = 3m_a.

Generating the full matrix and calculating the average moves for a particular
target pole confirms this for the 3-disc, 4-disc, and 3-disc with 4 poles
cases.

For the N-disc (3-pole) case, the biggest disc cannot be moved until the
N-1-disc case is solved, so M_N = M_{N-1} + m_{prebottom,N}, where
m_{prebottom,N} is the average number of additional moves needed when the
biggest disc is on the start pole and all the other discs are on another pole.

From this state, there are 3 moves, 2 of them move the smallest disc
to the closest state to solving N-1 case, the average moves from which
the N-1 case can solved for by inverting the N-1 matrix.  Call them
m_{last,N-1}, since they should be equal due to symmetry.

m_{prebottom,N} = 1 + 2/3×(m_{prebottom,N} + m_{last,N-1}) + 1/3×m_{postbottom,N}

where m_{postbottom,N} is the average moves from which the N-disc is solved
where the start pole is empty, the biggest disc is on one pole, all the other
discs are on the other pole.  From this state, there are 3 moves, one of
which moves the largest disc back to the start pole.  The other two moves
are the N-1-disc case where a particular pole is the target, but there's a
chance of coming back to this state, which feeds back into the matrix,
but it should just add a constant value to the average number of moves needed
for every state.

m_{postbottom,N} = 1/3×(1 + m_{prebottom,N}) + 2/3×(2M_{N-1}/R_{N-1} + (1-1/R_{N-1})(m_{last,N-1}+m_{postbottom,N}))

where R_N is the number of times on average the state returns to the initial
state in the N-disc case.

Calculating R_N:

Let r_{x,y,z} be the average number of times a state is visited between the
initial state and the end state.

r_{x,y,z} = sum over a,b,c r_{a,b,c}/number of states accessible from a,b,c

where a,b,c are the states accessible from x,y,z.

For N=2, using the symmetry r_{x,y,z} = r_{x,z,y} and the boundary
condition r_{,12,} = 0:
``
r_{12,,} = 1 + r_{2,1,}/3 + r_{2,,1}/3 = 1 + 2r_{2,1,}/3
r_{2,1,} = r_{,1,2}/3 + r_{12,,}/2 + r_{2,,1}/3 = r_{,1,2}/3 + r_{12,,}/2 + r_{2,1,}/3 = r_{,1,2}/2 + 3r_{12,,}/4
r_{,1,2} = r_{1,,2}/3 + r_{,,12}/2 + r_{2,1,}/3 = r_{1,2,}/3 + r_{2,1,}/3
r_{1,2,} = r_{,12,}/2 + r_{,2,1}/3 + r_{1,,2}/3 = r_{,1,2}/3 + r_{1,2,}/3 = r_{,1,2}/2

r_{1,2,} = r_{,1,2}/2
r_{,1,2} = r_{1,2,}/3 + r_{2,1,}/3 = r_{,1,2}/6 + r_{2,1,}/3 = 2r_{2,1,}/5
r_{2,1,} = r_{,1,2}/2 + 3r_{12,,}/4 = r_{2,1,}/5 + 3r_{12,,}/4 = 15r_{12,,}/16

r_{12,,} = 1 + 2r_{2,1,}/3 = 1 + 5r_{12,,}/8 = 8/3
```
So R_2 = r_{12,,} - 1 = 5/3.

```
M_2 = 32/3
m_{last,2} = 11
R_2 = 5/3

m_{prebottom,3} = 1 + 2/3×(m_{prebottom,3} + m_{last,2}) + 1/3×m_{postbottom,3}
m_{postbottom,3} = 1/3×(1 + m_{prebottom,3}) + 2/3×(2M_2/R_2 + (1-1/R_2)(m_{last,2}+m_{postbottom,3}))

m_{prebottom,3} = 25 + m_{postbottom,3}
m_{postbottom,3} = 151/3

m_{prebottom,3} = 226/3

M_3 = 258/3 (should be 637/9)
```
So something is incorrect.  I think R_N is too small, because R_N is for
reaching either pole, rather than the one particular pole.
```
M_2 = 32/3
m_{last,2} = 11
R_2 = 10/3

m_{prebottom,3} = 25 + m_{postbottom,3}

m_{postbottom,3} = 1/3×(1 + m_{prebottom,3}) + 2/3×(2×32/3×3/10 + 7/10×(11+m_{postbottom,3}))
30m_{postbottom,3} = 10 + 10m_{prebottom,3} + 128 + 14×11+14m_{postbottom,3}
m_{postbottom,3} = 146/3

m_{prebottom,3} = 221/3

M_3 = 253/3 (should be 637/9)
```
Still not right.  Giving up.
