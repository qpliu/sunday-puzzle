The hundreds column is 2×2×3×3×3×3×3×3×3×3×7, so the digits can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9.

The tens column is 2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×3×5, so the digits can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

The ones column is 2×2×2×2×2×3×5×5×7×7, so the digits can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

280 is 2×2×2×5×7, and can be ~~758~~ or 785, which eliminates all other 7s from the hundreds column.

168 is 2×2×2×3×7, and can be 387, ~~467~~, or ~~647~~.

162 is 2×3×3×3×3, and can be ~~992~~, ~~693~~, ~~396~~, ~~936~~, or 963.

360 is 2×2×2×3×3×5, and can be 985 or ~~958~~.

60 is 2×2×3×5, and can be ~~265~~, ~~256~~, ~~625~~, ~~652~~, ~~435~~, ~~453~~, 354, or ~~345~~.

256 is 2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2, and can only be 488, which eliminates all other even digits from the hundreds column.

126 is 2×3×3×7, and can be ~~367~~ or 927.

Since there is 1 factor of 3 in the ones column, 992, 396, and 936 are eliminated.

Since there are 5 factors of 2 in the ones column, 758, 958, and 345 are eliminated.

Since there is only 1 factor of 3 in the tens column, 367 is eliminated.

That leaves 785 387 963 985 354 488 927.
