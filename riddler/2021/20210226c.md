==========================
There is one choice for the first block: 0001

There are two choices for the second block:
* On top of the first block: 0002
* Next to the first block: 0011

For the third block, there are two choices:
* 2nd on top of 1st
 * 3rd on top of 2nd: 0003
 * 3rd next to 1st: 0012
* 2nd next to 1st
 * 3rd on top of 1st: 0012

Adding them up, there are 768 ways.

Using [code](20210226c.hs) to calculate the general case:
|N |ways|
|--|----|
|1 |1|
|2 |2|
|3 |16|
|4 |768|
|5 |292864|
|6 |1100742656|
|7 |48608795688960|
|8 |29258366996258488320|
|9 |273035280663535522487992320|
|10|44261486084874072183645699204710400|
|11|138018895500079485095943559213817088756940800|
|12|9079590132732747656880081324531330222983622187548672000|

There's probably some combinatorics akin to Pascal's triangle giving a closed
form solution for the general case, but I don't have the insight to find it.

Attempt at formulating the problem
----------------------------------
In general, the number of ways to build any possible intermediate configuration is
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w(h_1,h_2,...,h_N) = w(h_1-1,h_2,h_3,...,h_N) %2b w(h_1,h_2-1,h_3,...,h_N) %2b ... %2b w(h_1,h_2,...,h_N-1)">.

The constraints can be expressed as
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w(h_1,h_2,...,h_N) = 0"> if any
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=h_i < 0">,
or if any
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=h_i > h_j"> where
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i < j">.

Also,
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w(0,0,...,0) = 1">.

The number of ways to build the stairs is
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w(1,2,...,N)">.

### Symmetry
There's a symmetry between building out and building up.

For one step from finishing the stairs,
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w(0,2,...,N) = w(1,2,...,N-1)">
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w(1,1,3,...,N-1,N) = w(1,2,3,...,N-2,N)">
* ...
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w(1,2,...,i-1,...,j,...,N) = w(1,2,...i,...,j-1,...,N)"> for all <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i %2b j - 1 = N">

It's not clear how to express this symmetry in general.

Perhaps some other formulation can take advantage of this symmetry.

Another attempt at formulating the problem
------------------------------------------
The number of ways to build the stairs is
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w((N,N),(N-1,N-1),...,(N/2,N/2))">.

In general, the number of ways to build any possible intermediate configuration is
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w((h_1,b_1),(h_2,b_2),...,(h_{N/2},b_{N/2}))">.

The symmetry can be expressed as
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w((h_1,b_1),(h_2,b_2),...,(h_{N/2},b_{N/2})) = w((b_1,h_1),(b_2,h_2),...,(b_{N/2},h_{N/2}))">.

The initial condition is
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w((0,0),(0,0),...,(0,0)) = 1">.

The constraints are
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w = 0"> if any
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=h_i < 0"> or
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b_i < 0">, or if
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=h_i < h_j"> for any
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i < j">, or if
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b_i < b_j"> for any
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i < j">.

It's also possible to derive
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w((h_1,1),(0,1),...) = 1"> for all <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=h_1 > 0".

However, it's not immediately obvious what the recursive expression for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=w"> is in this formulation, since reducing some of the heights also reduces one of the breadths and vice versa.
