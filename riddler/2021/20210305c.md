==========================
I assume that more than 1000 games do not apply, since it's not possible
to bat more than 1.000 and there is no upper bound.

BA = h/AB

AB = 4×g

If there is a matched rounded batting average, then, for some h,

|1000×BA - g| < 1/2

or

(2g²-g)/500 < h < (2g²+g)/500

If there is no whole number h that satisfies these inequalities for a
given g, then it is not possible to have a matched rounded batting average.

When the gap in which h must exist is less than 1 gives an upper bound for g,
which is 250.

Using [code](20210305c.hs), the greatest number of games that does not have
a possible matched rounded batting average is 239.  Getting 228 hits in 956
at bats is 0.238 (0.2̅3̅8̅4̅9̅3̅7̅) and getting 229 hits is 0.240 (0.239̅5̅3̅9̅7̅4̅8̅).
