==========================
The volume is V = πr²h.

The crust area is A = πr²+2πrh.

For a given A, h = A/2πr - r/2.

V = Ar/2 - πr³/2.

Maximizing V with respect to r when r > 0

dV/dr = A/2 - 3πr²/2 = 0

πr² = A/3

The fraction of the crust to make the base is f = πr²/A, so the volume
maximizing fraction is 1/3.
