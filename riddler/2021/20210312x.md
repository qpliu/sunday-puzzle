==========================
If I had worked for more than an hour, it would have been 100%.

Let's say the cycle starts at 6:00 with a nap, 8:00 with eating and play,
then repeats at 9:00.

That means I was handed the baby monitor at 7:30, 8:30, 10:30, 11:30,
13:30, 14:30, 16:30, or 17:30, and heard the cry at 8:00, 9:00, 11:00,
12:00, 14:00, 15:00, 17:00, or 18:00.

If it was 8:00, 11:00, 14:00, or 17:00, it was hunger.

If it was 9:00, 12:00, 15:00, or 18:00, it was tiredness.

Then the chance of hunger would be 1/2.

Since crying at 6:00 due to tiredness doesn't make sense after 12 hours of
sleep, maybe it makes more sense for the cycle to start at 8:00, and there
would be another hunger cry at 20:00, followed by the 12-hour sleep.

In that case, the chance of hunger would be 5/9.
