Since there are only a few possibilities to consider, searching by hand seems
feasible.

The next few might be in the ranges 490-499, 640-649, 810-819, 1000-1009,
1210-1219, 1690-1699, 2250-2259, 2560-2569, 2890-2899, 3240-3249, 3610-3619,
4000-4009, 4410-4419, 4840-4849, 5290-5299, 5760-5769, 6250-6259, 6760-6769,
7290-7299, 7840-7849, 8410-8419, 9000-9009, 9610-9619, 10240-10249,
10890-10899, 11560-11569, 12250-12259, 12960-12969, 13690-13699, 14440-14449,
15210-15219, 16000-16009, 16810-16819, 17640-17649, 18490-18499, 19360-19369,
20250-20259, 21160-21169, 22090-22099, 23040-23049, 24010-24019, 25000-25009,
26010-26019, 27040-27049, 28090-28099, 29160-29169, 30250-30259, 31360-31369,
32490-32499.

The next one is 18² = 324 and 57² = 3249.  Searching by hand took longer than
I thought.

The search is for

10n² + a = m², a ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Since 3² = 9 is close to 10, I'd expect 3n < m < 4n.

For each n, let m be the smallest whole number greater than n√10, then, if
a = m² - 10n² is < 10, then m is an extra perfect square.

Resorting to code,

|n   |m   |a|m²     |

For a doubly extra perfect square, then
10m² + b = p², b ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Using code for a brute force search gave an erroneous result, due to the
limited precision of sqrt(10).
```
320224786²  = 102543913568745796
1012639687² = 1025439135687457969
3202247860² = 10254391356874579600
```

Here's the code:
```
take 2 $ filter ((< 10) . snd) $ map (\ n -> let m = ceiling (sqrt 10*fromIntegral n) in let p = ceiling (sqrt 10*fromIntegral m) in ((n,m,p,n^2,m^2,p^2),max (m^2 - 10*n^2) (p^2 - 10*m^2))) [1..]
```

Looking at the table, I conjecture that the sequence of last digits of m²
is 6, 9, 9, 6, 1, 4, 9, repeating.  I don't know how to prove that.  But
I can prove that 1, 4, 6, 9 are the only possible last digits.  Proving
that 0 is impossible is easy because n² has to have an even number
of factors of 2 and 5, so tacking on a 0 would make them odd.  There are no
squares with 2, 3, 7, or 8 as the last digit.  That leaves 5.  If the last
digit in an extra perfect square were 5, then 2n²+1 would have to have an
odd number of factors of 5 (and zero factors of 2, which is self-evident),
which means the last digit of n² would have to be 2, which is no square has.

Each of the last two digits of a doubly extra perfect square would have to be
one of 1, 4, 6, or 9.  That means it would have to end in
16, 49, 64, 44, 69, 96, 61, or 41, which means its square root would have to
end in 04, 07, 08, 12, 13, 14, 19, 21, 29, 31, 36, 37, 38, 42, 43, 46, 54, 57,
58, 62, 63, 64, 69, 71, 79, 81, 86, 87, 88, 92, 93, or 96.

Perhaps this or some other line of reasoning could lead to a way to construct
a doubly extra perfect square or a proof that they are impossible, but
I don't have the insight to make any further progress.

Insight
-------
Consider that (10n)² would be an extra perfect square in base 100, but
it cannot be an extra perfect square in base 10.

An extra perfect square in base 10 has to be one of
10n²+1, 10n²+4, 10n²+6, or 10n²+9.

A doubly extra perfect square would have to be one of
100n²+16,
100n²+41,
100n²+44,
100n²+49,
100n²+61,
100n²+64,
100n²+69,
or 100n²+96.

Since, q² = 100n² is a perfect square, (q+1)² = q² + 2q + 1,
so 2q+1 would have to be one of 16, 41, 44, 49, 61, 64, 69, or 96.
(Similarly for q+2, q+3, etc.)  This rules out doubly extra perfect
squares for large q.  And since there are no small doubly extra perfect
squares other than 169, there are no other doubly extra perfect squares.
