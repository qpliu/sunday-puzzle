==========================
There are 3 chords, of length s, L+s/√2, and 2L.

Let r be the circle radius.

r² = L² + h², where 2h = L+s/√2

r² = L² + (L/2 + s/√8)² = 5L²/4 + sL/√8 + s²/8

Solving for s, gives
s² = 2L² - 2L\sqrt{48r² - 64L²}

The key must be that the chord of length s, is at 45°.

Let sin𝛃 = h/r and sin𝛄 = s/2r,

𝛃 + 𝛄/2 = 𝛑/4

giving arcsin(s/2r) = 𝛑/2 - 2arcsin(h/r)

s/2r = sin(𝛑/2 - 2arcsin(h/r)) = cos(2arcsin(h/r)) =
cos²(arcsin(h/r)) - sin²(arcsin(h/r)) = L²/r² - h²/r²

Giving r = 2(L² - h²)/s

Substituting,

4(L² - h²)² = s²(L² + h²)

4(3L²/4 - sL/√8 - s²/8)² = s²(5L²/4 + sL/√8 + s²/8)

(3L²/2 - sL/√2 - s²/4)² = s²(5L²/4 + sL/√8 + s²/8)

9L⁴/4 - 3sL³/√2 - 3s²L²/4 + s³L/√8 + s²L²/2 + s⁴/16 = 5s²L²/4 + s³L/√8 + s⁴/8

9L⁴/4 - 3sL³/√2 - 6s²L²/4 - s⁴/16 = 0

Let f = L/s

9f⁴/4 - 3f³/√2 - 6f²/4 - 1/16 = 0

Numerically, that has a root at around f = 1.421476211

The answer is f², which is approximately 2.0205946.

Visually, I would have estimated f to be much closer to 2, and f² to be
at least 3.5, which doesn't give me much confidence in my answer, though
I don't see where my reasoning is wrong.
