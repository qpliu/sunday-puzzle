==========================
The number of points for of all the possible profiles are
* s(p q r) = p + pq + pqr
* s(p r q) = p + pr + prq
* s(q p r) = q + qp + qpr
* s(q r p) = q + qr + qrp
* s(r p q) = r + rp + rpq
* s(r q p) = r + rq + rqp
The last term, the points from the third shot, is the same in all cases.

Profiles that cannot result in the same number of points
* s(p q r) ≠ s(p r q)
* s(q p r) ≠ s(q r p)
* s(r p q) ≠ s(r q p)
* s(p q r) ≠ s(q p r)
* s(p r q) ≠ s(r p q)
* s(q r p) ≠ s(r q p)

Profiles that can possibly result in the same number of points
* s(p q r) = s(q r p) = s(r p q)
* s(p r q) = s(q p r) = s(r q p)

i.e. cyclic permutations.  So the answer is 3.
