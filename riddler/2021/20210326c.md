==========================
The number of points for of all the possible profiles are
* s(p q r) = p + pq + pqr
* s(p r q) = p + pr + prq
* s(q p r) = q + qp + qpr
* s(q r p) = q + qr + qrp
* s(r p q) = r + rp + rpq
* s(r q p) = r + rq + rqp
The last term, the points from the third shot, is the same in all cases.

Profiles that cannot result in the same number of points
* s(p q r) ≠ s(p r q)
* s(q p r) ≠ s(q r p)
* s(r p q) ≠ s(r q p)
* s(p q r) ≠ s(q p r)
* s(p r q) ≠ s(r p q)
* s(q r p) ≠ s(r q p)

Profiles that can possibly result in the same number of points
* s(p q r) = s(q r p) = s(r p q)
* s(p r q) = s(q p r) = s(r q p)

i.e. cyclic permutations.  So the answer is at most 3.

Let a = s - pqr.

Consider one of the two sets of cyclic permutations.

a = p + pq
a = q + qr
a = r + rp

p = a/(1+q)
q = a/(1+r)
r = a/(1+p)

p = a/(1+a/(1+a/(1+p)))

p(1+a/(1+a/(1+p))) = a

pa/(1+a/(1+p)) = a - p

pa = (a-p)(1+a/(1+p))

pa = a-p + (a²-ap)/(1+p)

(p+pa-a)(1+p) = a²-ap

p+p²+pa+p²a-a-ap = a²-ap

(1+a)p² + (1+a)p - (1+a)a = 0

Since a = p + pq cannot be negative, 1+a cannot be zero.

p² + p - a = 0

p = -1/2 ± √(1/4 + a)

Since 0 < a < 2, there is only one positive root.  But there should have been
3 solutions if p, q, r were all different, so the answer must be 1.
