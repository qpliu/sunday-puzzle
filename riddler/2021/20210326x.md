==========================
Let f be the ball handler's free throw percentage.

If we foul, the first free throw will result in hf + m(1-f) points,
where h = 1 + the number of points given up due to a second free throw,
and m is the number of points given up after a missed free throw.

h = 1 + f + m(1-f)

m = 1r, where r = 0.15.

Plugging these in gives 0.85f² + f + 0.15

We foul if 0.85f² + f + 0.15 < 1

The roots of 0.85f² + f - 0.85 = 0 are f = (-10 ± √389)/17,
and the positive root is approximately 0.571946.

We foul if the ball handler's free throw percentage is less than 57.19%.
