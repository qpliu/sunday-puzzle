==========================
Arbitrarily say the first answer is true due to symmetry.

The possible sequence of answers are
* ttft
* ttff
* tftt
* tftf
* tfft

If the first two answers are the same, betting everything on the third
question doubles the money.

If the first two answers are different, we can be sure that the
last two are not both the same as the second answer.  If the third answer
is different than the second answer, then fourth answer could be either.
If the third answer is the same as the second answer, betting everything
that remains on the fourth answer doubles that.  So if the first two
answers are different, betting 1/3 on that the third answer is different
than the second answer can guarantee winning 1/3.

Exploiting the difference between winning 1 when the second answer is
the same as the first and winning 1/3 when the second answer is different
that the first, betting b that the second answer is different than the first
means ending up with either 2(1-b) or 4(1+b)/3.  So b = 1/5 to maximize the
guaranteed winnings, which is 3/5, or $0.60.
