==========================
If it is my turn, if I can leave 2, I win, so if there are 3 or 4 on my turn,
I win.  That means on my previous turn, I need to have left 6, so there
would have to have been 7 or 8 on my previous turn.  And 11 or 12 on the turn
before that, etc.  So I win if there are initially 4N-1 or 4N,
where N=1,2,3..., and I go first.

If it is Wenjun's turn, if he leaves 1 or 2, he wins and if he leaves 0,
3, or 4, he loses.  So if there are 2 or 6, he loses, and if there are 1,
3, 4, or 5, he wins.  That means on his previous turn, he needs to have
left 5 or 6 to win, and leaving 3, 4, or 7 would lose, so there would have
to have been 7, 8, or 9 to win.  And leaving 8 or 11 on the turn before that
would lose and leaving 9 or 10 would win, so having 11, 12, or 13 would win,
etc.  So he wins if there are initially 4N-3, 4N-1, or 4N, where N=1,2,3...,
and he goes first.
