==========================
There are 4096 possible arrangements, so it's possible to do a brute force
computation.

Since there is no point in considering paths that return to an intersection,
there are 12 possible paths to consider.

Labeling the northern intersections from west to east as A, B, C,
the middle intersections east as D, E, F, and the southern intersections
as G, H, I, the paths are
* A B C F I
* A B C F E H I
* A B C F E D G H I
* A B E F I
* A B E H I
* A B E D G H I
* A D G H I
* A D G H E F I
* A D G H E B C F I
* A D E H I
* A D E F I
* A D E B C F I

Using [code](20210409c.hs) to do the brute force calculation gives 1135/4096
or about 27.7% as the chance of a drivable path.
