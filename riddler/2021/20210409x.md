==========================
To make the reasoning easier, I'll assume that the water originally from A
and the water originally from B get evenly mixed so that when pouring, half
of the water originally from A and half of the water originally from B get
poured.

Initially, cup A has A and 0, and cup B has 0 and B.

After the first pour, cup A has A/2 and 0, and cup B has A/2 and B.

After the second pour, cup A has 3A/4 and B/2, and cup B has A/4 and B/2.

After the third pour, cup A has 3A/8 and B/4, and cup B has 5A/8 and 3B/4.

After the fourth pour, cup A has 11A/16 and 5B/8, and cup B has 5A/16 and 3B/8.

After the fifth pour, cup A has 11A/32 and 5B/16, and cup B has 21A/32 and 11B/16.

After the sixth pour, cup A has 43A/64 and 21B/32, and cup B has 21A/64 and 11B/32.

Focus on the proportion of water originally in cup A that is in cup A, since
the rest of the water would be in cup B, and the proportion of water originally
in cup B follows the same sequence delayed by one pour.

The sequence is 1, 1/2, 3/4, 3/8, 11/16, 11/32, 43/64, 43/128, 171/256,
eventually converging to alternating between 1/3 and 2/3.

That means cup A would alternate between 2A/3+B/3 and A/3+2B/3, and
cup B would alternate between A/3+2B/3 and 2A/3+B/3.

So if both cups started with 8 oz, cup A would have about half the water.

In the general case, the fraction of the total water in a cup would alternate
between about (1 + A/(A+B))/3 and about (1 + B/(A+B))/3.

Correcting incorrect reasoning
------------------------------
I was adding the water originally in A and originally in B incorrectly,
as if I were simultaneously pouring the water originally in A from one
cup to another while pouring the water originally in B from the other cup.

I believe that the water originally in A and the water originally in B
converge to alternating between 1/3 and 2/3, but adding them correctly
means the cups would alternate between (A+B)/3 and 2(A+B)/3.
