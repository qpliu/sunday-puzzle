==========================
The simplifying assumptions leads to a half-black half-white sphere
rotating at a constant rate.

Let α be the angle of rotation where α = 0 is the new moon and α = π/2 is
the half moon and α = π is the full moon.

Consider a very thin slice of the sphere sliced at constant latitude, which
would be a rotating disk or ring that is half-white or half-black.  The
fractions of white and black of the projection onto a line are the same
as the fractions of white and black of the projection of the sphere onto
a circle.

Let x be the point where the white and black projections meet.

x = cosα

The black portion of the line is 1 + x, the white portion is 1 - x.

When the moon is 1/6 full, 1 - x = 1/3, or cosα = 2/3.

When the moon is 1/2 full, 1 - x = 1, or cosα = 0.

The growth rate of the white part is -dx/dα = sinα.

When the moon is 1/6 full, -dx/dα = √5/3.

When the moon is 1/2 full, -dx/dα = 1, which is 3/√5, or about 1.34, times
faster than when the moon is 1/6 full.
