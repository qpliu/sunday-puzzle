==========================
The large number of voters and the central limit theorem means a normal
distribution for the vote differential.

The chance of the vote differential being x is e^{-x^2/2}/\sqrt{2\pi}.

If the vote differential of the 80% is x, then the vote differential of
the 20% would have to be greater than x in the opposite direction.  The
standard deviation scales as n^{-1/2}, so the 20% vote would have to be
2 times as far from the mean in the probability distribution as the 80%
vote.

Since it doesn't matter which direction the vote goes as long as they are
in opposite directions, rescale the chances so that the integrals from
zero to infinity are 1.  So let the probability distribution of the vote
differential be 2e^{-x^2}/\sqrt{\pi}.

If the vote differential of the 80% is x, the probability that the vote
differential of the 20% at least matches x is
\int_{2x}^{\infty} dy 2e^{-y^2}/\sqrt{\pi} = 1 - erf(2x).

Then, integrating that probability over the probability distribution of the
vote differential of the 80%:

\frac{2}{\sqrt\pi}\int_0^\infty dx (1 - erf(2x)) e^{-x^2}

Using 4.3.2 in this [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/73B/jresv73Bn1p1_A1b.pdf](integral table):

1 - (1 - (2/\pi) tan^{-1}(1/2)) = 2/\pi tan^{-1}(1/2)

Then, the chance that the vote differential of the 20% is in the opposite
direction as the vote differential of the 80%, is half, giving
tan^{-1}(1/2)/\pi, or approximately 14.76%.
