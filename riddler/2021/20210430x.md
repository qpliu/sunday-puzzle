==========================
There are 81 possible combinations of throws.  However, many of those can be
ruled out.

One strategy is to make an aggressive throw at 18 points, and a conservative
throw at 19 and 20 points, and wasted throws otherwise.  However, I have to
consider the possibility that making conservative throws on the first or
second throw at 18 points could have a better chance of winning than
aggressive throws.  But it is clear that an aggressive throw is the only
choice at 18 points on the third or fourth throw.  It's also clear that
a wasted throw is not an option at less than 21 points.

Working backwards from the last throw gives 85.48% as best winning probability.
