Sounds like a binary search.

From the example,

Martina: My number is probably bigger.  _M > 1/2_

Olivia: My number is probably bigger.  _O > 3/4_

Martina: My number is probably bigger.  _M > 7/8_

Olivia: My number is probably bigger.  _O > 15/16_

Martina: Oliviaâ€™s number is probably bigger.  _M < 31/32_

_7/8 < M < 31/32_ and _15/16 < O < 1_.

The probability _in this case_ that they are right is

\int_{7/8}^{31/32} (32/3) dM \int_{15/16}^1 H(O-M) 16 dO =
\int_{7/8}^{15/16} (32/3) dM \int_{15/16}^1 16 dO + \int_{15/16}^{31/32} (32/3) dM \int_M^1 16 dO =
2/3 + \int_{15/16}^{31/32} (32/3) 16 dM (1-M) =
2/3 + \int_{15/16}^{31/32} (512/3) d(M-M^2/2) =
2/3 + (512/3) (1/32 - (1/2)((31/32)^2 - (30/32)^2)) = 11/12

Let A_n be the chance they agree after n turns and B_n be the chance that they
are correct in that case, then the chance that they are correct on any given
round is \sum_{n=1}\infty A_nB_n.

### Turn 1
The chance of agreement is 0.

The chance that Martina will say one number is bigger is 1.  (In the
infinitesmal chance that her number is exactly 1/2, she'd have to randomly
pick which one to say is bigger.)

### Turn 2
The chance of agreement is 3/4.  The chance of going onto turn 3 is 1/4.
(This bodes well for a quickly converging answer.)

In the case of agreement, the chance that they are right is
\int_{1/2}^1 2dM \int_0^{3/4} (4/3)H(M-O) dO =
\int_{1/2}^1 2dM \int_0^{1/2} (4/3) dO + \int_O^1 2dM \int_{1/2}^{3/4} (4/3) dO =
2/3 + \int_{1/2}^{3/4} (8/3) (1-O) dO =
2/3 + \int_{1/2}^{3/4} (8/3) d(O-O^2/2) =
2/3 + (8/3) (1/4 - (1/2)(3^2/4^2-2^2/4^2)) =
2/3 + (8/3) (8/32 - (9-4)/32) =
2/3 + (1/12) (8 - 5) = 2/3 + 3/12 = 11/12

### Turn 3
The chance of agreement is 3/4, so the chance of agreement at this point
is 3/16 and the chance of going onto turn 4 is 1/16.

In the case of agreement, the chance that they are right is
\int_{1/2}^{7/8} (8/3) dM \int_{3/4}^1 4 H(O-M) dO =
\int_{1/2}^{3/4} (8/3) dM \int_{3/4}^1 4 dO + \int_{3/4}^{7/8} (8/3) dM \int_M^1 4 dO =
2/3 + \int_{3/4}^{7/8} (8/3) dM 4 (1-M) =
2/3 + (32/3) \int_{3/4}^{7/8} d(M-M^2/2) =
2/3 + (32/3) (1/8 - (1/2)(7^2/8^2 - 6^2/8^2)) =
2/3 + (32/3) (16/128 - (49 - 36)/128) =
2/3 + (1/12) (16 - 13) = 11/12

2^(n+1) - ((2^n-1)^2 - (2^n-2)^2) = 3.

It looks like A_1 = 0, A_n = 3/(4^(n-1)), B_n = 11/12, giving the chance
that they agree correctly as 11/12.

I believe that choosing a split other than 1/2 wouldn't improve the chances
of being correct due to symmetry.  After further thought, I think that
belief is wrong.

Reconsidering the 1/2 split
---------------------------
Suppose the initial declaration signals that Martina's number is or is
not greater than f.

If Olivia agrees when her number is on the opposite side of f, then
A_2 = 2f-2f^2 and B_2 = 1.

The chance that Olivia disagrees is 1-2f+2f^2, meaning they are on the
same side of f, making the new range where both numbers are either
between 0 and f or between f and 1.

For Martina's next declaration, the split should either be f or 1-f,
where disagreeing with Olivia's last declaration signals that Martina's
number is in the larger side of the split.  Assuming f <= 1/2, that makes
A_3 = (1-A_2)f, and B_3 = 1-f/2.

The chance that Martina disagrees is 1-f.  For Olivia's turn,
A_4 = (1-A_2-A_3)f and B_4 = 1.

If Olivia disagrees, then there is a new smaller range that contains
both numbers.

So for every 2 turns, the outcomes are a f chance of Martina agreeing with
a 1-f/2 chance of being right, a (1-f)f chance of Olivia agreeing with a
1 chance of being right, and a (1-f)^2 chance of continuing.

So after the first two turns, the chance being right is 3/2-1/(2-f).

The chance of agreeing on the 2nd turn is 2f-2f^2, so the chance of
going on to the 3rd turn is 1-2f+2f^2, so the chance of being right
for the round is
2f-2f^2+(1-2f+2f^2)(3/2-1/(2-f)) = 3/2-f+f^2-(1-2f+2f^2)/(2-f).

If f = 1/2, the chance of being right is 3/2-1/2+1/4-(2/4)/(3/2) = 11/12.

If f is small, the chance of being right is 1 - f/4 + O(f^2).

So the chance that they agree correctly can be arbitrarily close to 100%
by agreeing on a sufficiently small f.

Extra Credit
------------
Their chances should be 100%, since Martina can bisect the remaining and
signal whether her number is in the upper fraction or lower fraction
without having to stop when agreeing with Olivia's previous declaration,
and Olivia can agree only when her number is in the opposite fraction.
