Sounds like a binary search.

From the example,

Martina: My number is probably bigger.  _M > 1/2_

Olivia: My number is probably bigger.  _O > 3/4_

Martina: My number is probably bigger.  _M > 7/8_

Olivia: My number is probably bigger.  _O > 15/16_

Martina: Oliviaâ€™s number is probably bigger.  _M < 31/32_

_7/8 < M < 31/32_ and _15/16 < O < 1_.

The probability _in this case_ that they are right is

\int_{7/8}^{31/32} (32/3) dM \int_{15/16}^1 H(O-M) 16 dO =
\int_{7/8}^{15/16} (32/3) dM \int_{15/16}^1 16 dO + \int_{15/16}^{31/32} (32/3) dM \int_M^1 16 dO =
2/3 + \int_{15/16}^{31/32} (32/3) 16 dM (1-M) =
2/3 + \int_{15/16}^{31/32} (512/3) d(M-M^2/2) =
2/3 + (512/3) (1/32 - (1/2)((31/32)^2 - (30/32)^2)) = 11/12

Let A_n be the chance they agree after n turns and B_n be the chance that they
are correct in that case, then the chance that they are correct on any given
round is \sum_{n=1}\infty A_nB_n.

### Turn 1
The chance of agreement is 0.

The chance that Martina will say one number is bigger is 1.  (In the
infinitesmal chance that her number is exactly 1/2, she'd have to randomly
pick which one to say is bigger.)

### Turn 2
The chance of agreement is 3/4.  The chance of going onto turn 3 is 1/4.
(This bodes well for a quickly converging answer.)

In the case of agreement, the chance that they are right is
\int_{1/2}^1 2dM \int_0^{3/4} (4/3)H(M-O) dO =
\int_{1/2}^1 2dM \int_0^{1/2} (4/3) dO + \int_O^1 2dM \int_{1/2}^{3/4} (4/3) dO =
2/3 + \int_{1/2}^{3/4} (8/3) (1-O) dO =
2/3 + \int_{1/2}^{3/4} (8/3) d(O-O^2/2) =
2/3 + (8/3) (1/4 - (1/2)(3^2/4^2-2^2/4^2)) =
2/3 + (8/3) (8/32 - (9-4)/32) =
2/3 + (1/12) (8 - 5) = 2/3 + 3/12 = 11/12

### Turn 3
The chance of agreement is 3/4, so the chance of agreement at this point
is 3/16 and the chance of going onto turn 4 is 1/16.

In the case of agreement, the chance that they are right is
\int_{1/2}^{7/8} (8/3) dM \int_{3/4}^1 4 H(O-M) dO =
\int_{1/2}^{3/4} (8/3) dM \int_{3/4}^1 4 dO + \int_{3/4}^{7/8} (8/3) dM \int_M^1 4 dO =
2/3 + \int_{3/4}^{7/8} (8/3) dM 4 (1-M) =
2/3 + (32/3) \int_{3/4}^{7/8} d(M-M^2/2) =
2/3 + (32/3) (1/8 - (1/2)(7^2/8^2 - 6^2/8^2)) =
2/3 + (32/3) (16/128 - (49 - 36)/128) =
2/3 + (1/12) (16 - 13) = 11/12

2^(n+1) - ((2^n-1)^2 - (2^n-2)^2) = 3.

It looks like A_1 = 0, A_n = 3/(4^(n-1)), B_n = 11/12, giving the chance
that they agree correctly as 11/12.

I believe that choosing a split other than 1/2 wouldn't improve the chances
of being correct due to symmetry.

Extra Credit
------------
Their chances should be 100%, since Martina can bisect the remaining and
signal whether her number is in the upper fraction or lower fraction
without having to stop when agreeing with Olivia's previous declaration,
and Olivia can agree only when her number is in the opposite fraction.
