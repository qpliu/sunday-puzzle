==========================
Based on the hint, I surmise the numbers are e^{ia\pi}, e^{ib\pi}, e^{ic\pi},
where b = 2a + 2n, c = 2b + 2m, a = 2c + 2p, where n, m, and p are integers.

a = 8a + 8n + 4m + 2p.

Choosing n = 0, m = 0, p = -1, then a = 2/7, b = 4/7, c = 8/7 and the
numbers are e^{2i\pi/7}, e^{4i\pi/7}, and e^{8i\pi/7}.

Choosing n = 0, m = 0, p = 1, the numbers are
e^{-2i\pi/7}, e^{-4i\pi/7}, and e^{-8i\pi/7}.
