==========================
The first thing to determine is whether starting the last round wins or not
to determine whether it is preferable to say 19 or 20 when both are an option.

For the last round, saying 16 through 19 loses, so saying 15 wins, so saying
11-14 loses, so saying 10 wins, so saying 6-9 loses, so saying 5 wins and
saying 1 loses.  That means starting the last round loses.

For the round of 3, the preferable outcome is to say 20 and go second in the
last round.  The secondary preferable outcome is to say 16-19 and not be
eliminated.  Saying 15 is a certain loser, so nobody will ever say 15.
Saying 12-14 is similarly a certain loser.  So saying 11 is a certain winner.
That means saying 7-10 is secondarily preferable and 3-6 is a loser, and
saying 2 is a winner.

Player B wins.
