==========================
With the first method, the amount remaining is
(1/2)×(2/3)×(3/4)×(4/5)×...×((n-1)/n) = 1/n, which is nothing when n→∞.

With the second method, the amount remaining is ∏((n²-1)/n²)
where n = 2, 3, 4... or
(3/4)×(8/9)×(15/16)×(24/25)×...×(n-2)(n+0)/(n-1)²×(n-1)(n+1)/n²
or (1/2)×(n+1)/n, which is 1/2 when n→∞.
