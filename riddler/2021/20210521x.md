==========================
The smallest Pythagorean slice has sides of 3-4-5, with an area of 6.
Based on the area, the upper limit is 4 from a square of area 25.

And it is possible to make 4 slices by making cuts of length 4 at an
angle of tan⁻¹¾ from each corner, leaving a 1×1 square as the leftover
in the middle.

------------
Two 3-4-5 slices can make a 3×4 rectangle.

Two 5-12-13 slices can make a 5×12 rectangle.

A 12×12 square could be made from a 5×12 rectangle and 7 3×4 rectangles,
where the 3 of 3×4 rectangles make a 3×12 rectangle and the other 4
make a 4×12 rectangle.
