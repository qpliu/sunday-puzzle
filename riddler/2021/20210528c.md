==========================
The polyhedron has 4 faces, 2 equilateral triangles with edges 1,1,1 and 2
isosceles triangles with edges 1,1,L.

Let two of the vertices be at (0,½,0) and (0,-½,0).

Let h = (1-L<sup>2</sup>/4)<sup>½</sup>.

The other two vertices are at (L/2,0,h) and (-L/2,0,h).

The area of the rectangular cross-sections as a function of z is
z(1 - z/h)L/h.

Integrating over z from 0 to h gives the volume V = Lh/6.

To find the maximum volume, dV/dL = h/6 - L<sup>2</sup>/24h = 0
when L<sup>2</sup> = 4h<sup>2</sup> = 4 - L<sup>2</sup>, or
L = √2.

That makes h = √2 and the maximum volume V = 1/3.
