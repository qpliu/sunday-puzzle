==========================
Given an OBP for all batters, the chance that a pitching staff pitches
a perfect game in any given game is p = (1-OBP)<sup>27</sup>.

There are 4860 chances at a perfect game in a season.

Counting an extra inning game resulting from two teams pitching nine perfect
innings in the same game as two perfect games, the expected number of
perfect games is 4860p.

If 4860p = 1, then OBP = 1 - 4860<sup>-1/27</sup>, or approximately 0.26977.
