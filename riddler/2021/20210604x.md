When dividing a length L into 2 pieces, of length a and L-a, the product is
aL - a², which is maximized when a = L/2.

When dividing a length L into 2 pieces of length L/2, the product of the
lengths of the pieces is L²/4, which which means if L > 2, dividing the
length increases the product, while if L < 2, dividing the length decreases
the product.

Considering when the number of pieces are powers of 2, then
* 2 pieces of length 5 gives 25
* 4 pieces of length 5/2, which is > 2, gives 625/16 = 39.0625
* 8 pieces of length 5/4, which is < 2, gives 390625/65536 = 5.9604644775390625

Now, consider dividing a length L into 3 pieces.  First, divide it into two
pieces, length a, L-a.  Then, we know that dividing one of the pieces into
two pieces means dividing it into half, giving lengths a/2, a/2, and L-a,
making the product a²L/4-a³/4, which is maximized when a = 2L/3.

So, when dividing length L into 3 pieces, the product is maximized by
dividing into equal thirds.

In general, dividing a length L into n pieces, the product is maximized by
dividing into equal lengths because if there are any unequal lengths, the
product can be increased by replacing any two pieces of unequal lengths
with two pieces of equal length where the sum of the lengths of the two
pieces are the unchanged.

So, when dividing into n pieces, the maximum product is Lⁿ/nⁿ.

Using code,
```haskell
    maximum [product (take n (repeat (10/fromIntegral n))) | n <- [1..10]] :: Rational
```
gives 625/16 = 39.0625, which divides the wand into 4 equal pieces.

Extra credit
------------
```haskell
    maximum [product (take n (repeat (100/fromIntegral n))) | n <- [1..100]] :: Rational
```
gives 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10555134955777783414078330085995832946127396083370199442517, or approximately 9.474061716781832e15,
which divides the wand into 37 equal pieces.

Generalizing
------------
Maximizing Lⁿ/nⁿ for real n, d/dn (Lⁿ/nⁿ) = Lⁿ/nⁿ (ln L - ln n - 1) = 0
when ln n = ln (L/e), or n = L/e.

When L = 10, n = L/e = 3.678794.

When L = 100, n = L/e = 36.787944.

Then, it's a matter of whether Lⁿ/nⁿ is greater when n = floor(L/e) or
when n = ceiling(L/e).

In general, the maximum product happens when dividing into equal lengths
that are closest to e.
