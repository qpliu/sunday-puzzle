Using [code](20210611c.hs) to explore the possibilities,
removing IL, MO, OK, and NM gives a western region with area 1,607,869,
and an eastern region with area 1,193,449, where area of the eastern
region is 38.2% of the area of the lower 48.

Making the eastern region bigger by removing MN, IA, MO, OK, and NM
gives a western region with area 1,382,787, and and eastern region
with area 1,333,236, where area of the eastern region is 42.7% of
the area of the lower 48.

Limiting the set of states for consideration for removal: with
a western edge of ID, WY, CO, NM, a northeastern edge of MN, IA, IL
IN, KY, VA, and excluding MT, TX, SC, and FL:
* trying to remove 4 states gives IL, MO, OK, NM, and region B with an area of
1,193,449 or 38.2%.
* trying to remove 5 states gives IL, MO, NE, CO, NM, and region B with an area
of 1,344,149 or 43.07%.
* trying to remove 6 states gives ID, WY, NE, MO, AR, MS, and region B with an
area of 1,341,666 or 42.99%.
* trying to remove 7 states gives the same answer as removing 6 states, plus
removing IN, for a region B with an area of 1,312,294 or 42.05%.
