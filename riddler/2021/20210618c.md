==========================
Due to symmetry, I only need consider the blue car entering the intersection
from due north.

I assume that if each car leaves the intersection on the road from which
the other car entered the intersection, there would be no crash.

I assume that if one car leaves the intersection on the road from which
the other car entered the intersection, a crash may or may not occur based
on the cars driving on the right side of the road.  For example, if the
blue car enters from due north and leaves due south and the red car enters
from due east and leaves due north, there is no crash, but if the red
car enters from due west and leaves due north, there is a crash.

Enumerating the cases
|Blue leaves|Red enters|Red leaves crash |Red leaves no crash|

Counting up the crash cases give the crash probability 154/343.

There are 42 crash cases where a car tries to leave on a road from which
the other car entered, so if those aren't counted as crashes, the crash
probability would be 112/343.

Extra credit
------------
When the number of roads approach infinity, the possiblity of a car leaving
on the road from which the other car entered becomes negligible.

Let the blue car enter at 0 and leave at ùúÉ, where 0 < ùúÉ < 2ùúã, and the red car
enter at ùõº and leave at ùúî.

If ùõº < ùúÉ and ùúî < ùúÉ, or if ùõº > ùúÉ and ùúî > ùúÉ, there is no crash, otherwise
there is a crash.

To make the integrals slightly simpler, rescale the ranges so that 0 < ùúÉ < 1.

The crash probability is
‚à´<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup>dùúÉ (‚à´<sub>0</sub><sup>ùúÉ</sup>dùõº‚à´<sub>ùúÉ</sub><sup>1</sup>dùúî + ‚à´<sub>ùúÉ</sub><sup>1</sup>dùõº‚à´<sub>0</sub><sup>ùúÉ</sup>dùúî) =
‚à´<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup>dùúÉ 2ùúÉ(1-ùúÉ) = ‚Öì.
