==========================
If you had already drawn 10 cards, you'd have 55 points, then drawing would
give a 100% chance of having 0 points.  So you walk if you already drew 10
cards.

If you had already drawn 9 cards for 45 to 54 points, then drawing would give
a 50% chance of having 0 points, and a 50% chance of getting to 55 points
and getting to having drawn 10 cards.  Walking locks in 45 to 54 points.
Since you'd walk if the 10th draw is not the joker, drawing would mean
you'd end up with 27½ points on average.  So you walk if you already drew 9
cards.

If you had already drawn 8 cards for 36 to 52 points, then drawing would give
a 1/3 chance of having 0 points, and a 2/3 chance of getting to 45 to 54
points and having drawn 9 cards.  Walking locks in 36 to 52 points.  Since
you'd walk if the 9th draw is not the joker, drawing means you'd end up with
30 to 36 points on average.  So you walk if you already drew 8 cards.

If you had already drawn 7 cards for 28 to 49 points, then drawing would give
a 1/4 chance of having 0 points, and 3/4 chance of getting to 36 to 52 points
and having drawn 8 cards.  Walking locks in 28 to 49 points.  Since you'd
walk if the 8th draw is not the joker, drawing means you'd end up with
27 to 39 points on average.  If you have 28 points, you'd have 1/4 chance of
having 0 points, 1/4 chance of having 36 points, 1/4 chance of having 37
points, and 1/4 chance of having 38 points, which is 27¾ points on average.
If you have 29 points, drawing would give you 28¼ points on average.
So you walk if you already drew 7 cards.

If you had already drawn 6 cards for 21 to 45 points, then drawing would
give you a 1/5 chance of having 0 points, and 4/5 chance of getting 28
to 49 points.  If you have 21 points and draw, you'd have 1/5 chance of
0 points, 1/5 chance at 28 points, 1/5 chance at 29 points, 1/5 chance at
30 points, and 1/5 chance at 31 points, which gives 23⅗ points on average.
If you have 22 points and draw, the outcomes are 0, 28, 30, 31, or 32 points,
or 24 points on average.  If you have 23 points from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and
draw, the outcomes are 0, 29, 30, 32, or 33 points, or 24⅘ points on average.
If you have 23 points from 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and draw, the outcomes are
0, 28, 31, 32, or 33 points, or 24⅘ points on average.  If you have 24 points
from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and draw, the outcomes are 0, 30, 31, 32, 34 points,
or 25⅖ on average.  If you have 24 points from any combination of 6 cards
and draw, you score 25⅖ on average.  If you have 25 points, there are a total
of 30 points left in the deck, so you score on average (25×4+30)/5 = 26 if you
draw.  If you have 26 points and draw, you score on average (26×4+29)/5 = 26⅗.
If you have 27 points and draw, you score on average (27×4+28)/5 = 27⅕.
If you have 28 points and draw, you score on average (28×4+27)/5 = 27⅘.
So you walk if you have 28 or more points and draw if you have 27 or less.

If you have N points and deck has M remaining cards with a total of T-N points,
where T=55, and draw and then walk if it's not the joker, you'd score
(N×(M-1)+T-N)/M on average, so if N > (N×(M-1)+T-N)/M, you walk, which
reduces to walking if N > T/2, or walking if you have at least 28 points.

Without doing the work, I'll assume that if you have much less than 28 points
and draw, you'll probably want to draw again, so the strategy is to keep
drawing as long as you have less than 28 points, then walk if you have at least
28 points.

Extra credit

maximum of 7 draws.
