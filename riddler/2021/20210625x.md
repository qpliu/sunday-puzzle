==========================
Let r, g, b be the number of marbles of each color.  r+g+b = 100.

The chance of picking r first, then g, then b is
rgb/((r+g+b)(r+g+b-1)(r+g+b-2)).

The chance is the same in any order,
so the chance of drawing three different colors is 6rgb/(100×99×98).

6rgb/(100×99×98) = 1/5.

rbg = 100×99×98/30 = 32340.

Factoring 32340 into 3 factors that add up to 100 gives 44×35×21.
