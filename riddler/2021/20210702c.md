==========================

For a given arrangement, finding the maximum score by taking every pair,
which gives a product plus two sub-arrangements, recursively finding the
maximum score of each sub-arrangement, then add the product to the maximum
sum of the two sub-arrangements.

There are 10!/2 = 1814400 possible arrangements.  I'll use [code](20210702.hs)
for a brute force search which I estimate will take about 75 hours on my
computer.
