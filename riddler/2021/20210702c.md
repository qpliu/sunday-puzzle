==========================
For a given arrangement, find the maximum score by taking every pair,
which gives a product plus two sub-arrangements, recursively finding the
maximum score of each sub-arrangement, then add the product to the sum
of the two maximum sub-arrangements.  (This is non-optimal, since the
pairs will be duplicated in many sub-arrangements.  Just pairing the
greatest number with each other number in the arrangement plus pairing the
second greatest number with each smaller number with would have been
significantly faster, taking 7-8 hours instead of 68 hours.  Additional
improvement could come from removing the greatest number from the recursive
calculations when pairing the second greatest number.)

There are 10!/2 = 1814400 possible arrangements.  I'll use [code](20210702c.hs)
for a brute force search which I estimate will take about 75 hours on my
computer.

After 68 hours of calculating the scores of 10!/2 arrangements, the least
maximum score is 224.  Here is a non-exhaustive list:
* 1,8,5,10,7,11,6,9,4,2,3
* 1,9,6,10,7,11,5,8,4,2,3
* 1,4,2,8,5,10,7,11,6,9,3
* 1,4,2,8,5,11,7,10,6,9,3
* 1,4,2,9,6,10,7,11,5,8,3
* 1,6,11,7,10,5,9,4,8,2,3
* 1,7,10,6,11,5,9,4,8,2,3
* 1,8,4,9,5,10,7,11,6,2,3
* 1,8,4,9,5,10,6,11,7,2,3
* 1,4,2,3,8,5,10,7,11,6,9
* 1,4,2,3,9,6,10,7,11,5,8

The connected pairs are:
* 3×4 + 5×6 + 8×9 + 10×11
* 3×4 + 6×9 + 7×10 + 8×11
* 3×5 + 8×9 + 6×10 + 7×11
* 3×6 + 4×7 + 9×10 + 8×11
* 3×7 + 4×6 + 8×10 + 9×11
