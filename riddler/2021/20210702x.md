==========================
There are 1 new champion and 10 new non-champions in the first 5 episodes.
The next episode adds a 1 new champion and 1 new non-champion, and the
following 4 episodes add 8 new non-champions, repeating 39 times.

That makes 40 champions and 361 non-champions.  If you pick randomly from
all contestants, the chance of picking a champion is 40/401, or approximately
9.98%.

If you pick a random episode, then randomly pick a contestant from that
episode, then chance of picking a champion is much higher.  There are 39
episodes with 2 champions, and 161 episodes with 1 champion, so the
chance is 2/3×39/200 + 1/3×161/200 = 239/600, or approximately 39.83%.
