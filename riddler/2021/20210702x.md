==========================
There are 1 new champion and 8 new non-champions in the first 4 episodes.
The next episode adds a 1 new champion and 1 new non-champion, and the
following 3 episodes add 6 new non-champions, repeating 49 times.

That makes 50 champions and 351 non-champions.  If you pick randomly from
all contestants, the chance of picking a champion is 50/401, or approximately
12.49%.

If you pick a random episode, then randomly pick a contestant from that
episode, then chance of picking a champion is much higher.  There are 49
episodes with 2 champions, and 151 episodes with 1 champion, so the
chance is 2/3×49/200 + 1/3×151/200 = 249/600 = 41.5%.
