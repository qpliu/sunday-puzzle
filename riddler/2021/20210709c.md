==========================
Let A = t/3, B = t/4, C = t/5 be the azimuthal angle of each planet from
alignment rescaled so that 1 is a complete orbit.

A and B are aligned when t/3 = t/4 + N, where N is an integer, or when
t = 12N.

A and C are aligned when t/3 = t/5 + M, where M is an integer, or when
t = 15M/2.

The two alignments align again when N = 5 and M = 8, or t = 60 years,
after A completes 20 orbits, B completes 15 orbits, and C completes 12
orbits.

This is wrong because being this requires the planets to be aligned with
the star, while the actual requirement is "collinear not necessarily
including the star".  Also, it's not stated whether the three orbits are
coplanar or if any orbit is retrograde.  I assume they are coplanar and
none of them are retrograde.

The planets could be lined up with the star when N or M is an integer plus
1/2 by being on the opposite side of the star, so when N = 5/2 and M = 4, or
t = 30 years has B on the opposite side of the star.

So the current state could be t = 0 or t = 30.

The current state could also have A on the opposite side of the star or C on
the opposite side of the star.

If the orbits are coplanar, and none are retrograde,

  x_A = 3cos(2πt/3)
  y_A = 3sin(2πt/3)
  x_B = 4cos(2πt/4)
  y_B = 4sin(2πt/4)
  x_C = 5cos(2πt/5)
  y_C = 5sin(2πt/5)

At time t, the line from A to B is

  y(x_A-x_B) = y_A(x-x_B) - y_B(x-x_A)

When the planets are aligned

  y_C(x_A-x_B) = y_A(x_C-x_B) - y_B(x_C-x_A)

or

  15sin(2πt/5)cos(2πt/3) - 20sin(2πt/5)cos(2πt/4) =
  15sin(2πt/3)cos(2πt/5) - 12sin(2πt/3)cos(2πt/4) +
  12sin(2πt/4)cos(2πt/3) - 20sin(2πt/4)cos(2πt/5)

which is

  12sin(2πt/12) - 15sin(4πt/15) + 20sin(2πt/20) = 0

which has 10 roots for 0 < t ≤ 60, the smallest of which is approximately
7.767.  The smallest root greater than 30 is approximately 40.255, or about
10.255 after that alignment.

If A has a retrograde orbit

  15sin(2πt/5)cos(2πt/3) - 20sin(2πt/5)cos(2πt/4) =
 -15sin(2πt/3)cos(2πt/5) + 12sin(2πt/3)cos(2πt/4) +
  12sin(2πt/4)cos(2πt/3) - 20sin(2πt/4)cos(2πt/5)

which is

  -12sin(14πt/12) + 15sin(16πt/15) + 20sin(2πt/20) = 0

which has 36 roots for 0 < t ≤ 60, the smallest of which is approximately
5.306.  The smallest root greater than 30 is approximately 30.844, or about
0.844 after that alignment.

If B has a retrograde orbit, then

  15sin(2πt/5)cos(2πt/3) - 20sin(2πt/5)cos(2πt/4) =
  15sin(2πt/3)cos(2πt/5) - 12sin(2πt/3)cos(2πt/4) -
  12sin(2πt/4)cos(2πt/3) + 20sin(2πt/4)cos(2πt/5)

which is

  12sin(14πt/12) - 15sin(4πt/15) - 20sin(18πt/20) = 0

which has 54 roots for 0 < t ≤ 60, the smallest of which is approximately
1.597.  The smallest root greater than 30 is approximately 31.039, or about
1.039 after that alignment.

If C has a retrograde orbit, then

 -15sin(2πt/5)cos(2πt/3) + 20sin(2πt/5)cos(2πt/4) =
  15sin(2πt/3)cos(2πt/5) - 12sin(2πt/3)cos(2πt/4) +
  12sin(2πt/4)cos(2πt/3) - 20sin(2πt/4)cos(2πt/5)

which is

  12sin(2πt/12) - 15sin(16πt/15) + 20sin(18πt/20) = 0

which has 54 roots for 0 < t ≤ 60, the smallest of which is approximately
1.634.  The smallest root greater than 30 is approxmiately 31.094, or about
1.094 after that alignment.

To consider when A or C are currently on the opposite side of the star,
repeat the calculations with

  x_A = -3cos(2πt/3)
  y_A = -3sin(2πt/3)

when none of the orbits are retrograde

 -15sin(2πt/5)cos(2πt/3) - 20sin(2πt/5)cos(2πt/4) =
 -15sin(2πt/3)cos(2πt/5) + 12sin(2πt/3)cos(2πt/4) +
 -12sin(2πt/4)cos(2πt/3) - 20sin(2πt/4)cos(2πt/5)

which is

  12sin(2πt/12) - 15sin(4πt/15) - 20sin(2πt/20) = 0

which has 8 roots for 0 < t ≤ 60, the smallest of which is approximately
11.123.  The smallest root greater than 30 is approximately 33.310, or about
3.310 after that alignment.

In all, assuming coplanar orbits, there are 16 possible answers depending on
which orbits are retrograde and which planets are currently on the opposite
side of the star.

If none of the orbits are retrograde, then
* 7.767 years if all the planets are currently on the same side of the star
* 11.123 years if A is currently on the opposite side of the star
* 10.255 years if B is currently on the opposite side of the star
* 3.310 years if C is currently on the opposite side of the star

If all the planets are on the same side of the star, then
* 7.767 years if no orbits are retrograde
* 5.306 years if A is retrograde
* 1.597 years if B is retrograde
* 1.634 years if C is retrograde
