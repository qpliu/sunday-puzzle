==========================
Let A = t/3, B = t/4, C = t/5 be the azimuthal angle of each planet from
alignment rescaled so that 1 is a complete orbit.

A and B are aligned when t/3 = t/4 + N, where N is an integer, or when
t = 12N.

A and C are aligned when t/3 = t/5 + M, where M is an integer, or when
t = 15M/2.

The two alignments align again when N = 5 and M = 8, or t = 60 years,
after A completes 20 orbits, B completes 15 orbits, and C completes 12
orbits.
