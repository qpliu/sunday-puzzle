==========================
Let A = t/3, B = t/4, C = t/5 be the azimuthal angle of each planet from
alignment rescaled so that 1 is a complete orbit.

A and B are aligned when t/3 = t/4 + N, where N is an integer, or when
t = 12N.

A and C are aligned when t/3 = t/5 + M, where M is an integer, or when
t = 15M/2.

The two alignments align again when N = 5 and M = 8, or t = 60 years,
after A completes 20 orbits, B completes 15 orbits, and C completes 12
orbits.

This is wrong because being this requires the planets to be aligned with
the star, while the actual requirement is "collinear not necessarily
including the star".  Also, it's not stated whether the three orbits are
coplanar or if any orbit is retrograde.  I assume they are coplanar and
none of them are retrograde.
