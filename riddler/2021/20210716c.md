==========================
First consider the cases of ties after the first five rounds.

Let p = 70%.

There is a p² + (1-p)² chance of an additional round and a 2p(1-p) chance
of ending.

So if it goes beyond the first five rounds, the number of shots after the
first ten is n₆ = 2⋅2p(1-p) + (2+n₆)(p² + (1-p)²), or n₆ = 1/(p-p²) = 100/21.

After the first round, the possibities are
* 1-1: p²
* 0-0: (1-p)²
* 1-0: p(1-p)
* 0-1: p(1-p)

After the second round
* 2-2: p²⋅p²
* 1-1: 4⋅p²⋅(1-p)²
* 2-1: 2⋅p²⋅p(1-p)
* 1-2: 2⋅p²⋅p(1-p)
* 0-0: (1-p)²⋅(1-p)²
* 1-0: 2⋅(1-p)²⋅p(1-p)
* 0-1: 2⋅(1-p)²⋅p(1-p)
* 2-0: p(1-p)⋅p(1-p)
* 0-2: p(1-p)⋅p(1-p)

A wrinkle is that the shootout could end after the first shot in round 4
or round 5 if the leading team shoots first and scores or if the trailing
team shoots first and misses.  So a shootout could have 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12,
14, ... shots.

Using [code](20210716c.hs) to add up the probabilities, the average number
of shots is 5360024797/525000000, or about 10.210.

Looking at the average number of shots vs the chance of a player making a
shot, the average number of shots is minimized when the chance a player makes
a shot is 50% at 625/64, or about 9.766.

If a player had a 10% or 90% chance of making a shot, the average number of
shots would be 3273834553/225000000, or about 14.550.

If a player had a 5% or 95% chance of making a shot, the average number of
shots would be 2815098149353/121600000000, or about 23.150.

If a player had a 1% or 99% chance of making a shot, the average number of
shots would be 25123143893545038553/247500000000000000, or about 101.508.
