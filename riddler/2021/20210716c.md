==========================
First consider the cases of ties after the first five rounds.

Let p = 70%.

There is a p² + (1-p)² chance of an additional round and a 2p(1-p) chance
of ending.

So if it goes beyond the first five rounds, the number of shots after the
first ten is n₆ = 2⋅2p(1-p) + (2+n₆)(p² + (1-p)²), or n₆ = 1/(p-p²) = 100/21.

After the first round, the possibilities are
* 1-1: p²
* 0-0: (1-p)²
* 1-0: p(1-p)
* 0-1: p(1-p)

After the second round
* 2-2: p²⋅p²
* 1-1: 4⋅p²⋅(1-p)²
* 2-1: 2⋅p²⋅p(1-p)
* 1-2: 2⋅p²⋅p(1-p)
* 0-0: (1-p)²⋅(1-p)²
* 1-0: 2⋅(1-p)²⋅p(1-p)
* 0-1: 2⋅(1-p)²⋅p(1-p)
* 2-0: p(1-p)⋅p(1-p)
* 0-2: p(1-p)⋅p(1-p)

A wrinkle is that the shootout could end after the first shot in round 4
or round 5 if the leading team shoots first and scores or if the trailing
team shoots first and misses.  So a shootout could have 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12,
14, ... shots.

Using [code](20210716c.hs) to add up the probabilities, the average number
of shots is 549682873/52500000, or about 10.470.

Looking at the average number of shots vs the chance of a player making a
shot, the average number of shots is minimized when the chance a player makes
a shot is 50% at 321/32, or about 10.031.

If a player had a 10% or 90% chance of making a shot, the average number of
shots would be 332091637/22500000, or about 14.760.

If a player had a 5% or 95% chance of making a shot, the average number of
shots would be 283243553427/12160000000, or about 23.293.

If a player had a 1% or 99% chance of making a shot, the average number of
shots would be 2513237840231089507/24750000000000000, or about 101.545.

I think it's fishy that the average number of shots approaches
n₆ = 1/(p-p²) as p approaches 0 or 1 instead of approaching 10 + n₆,
but I'm not seeing what I'm doing wrong.  It may be that the chance of
going beyond 5 rounds approaches n₆/(10+n₆) as n₆ gets large.

Consider when p approaches 0.  The chance of a 0-0 tie after 5 rounds is
(1-p)¹⁰ = 1 - 10p + ...  The average number of shots taken when there is
a 0-0 tie after 5 rounds is 10 + 1/(p-p²) = 10 + 1/p + ..., which, when
weighted by its chance of happening is 10 - 100p + 1/p - 10 + ..., or
approximately 1/p, which is also approximately n₆, so the first 10 shots
are indeed neatly canceled out on average.
