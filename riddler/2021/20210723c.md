==========================
Resorting to [code](20210723c.go) to run simulations.
There are a maximum of 9 gaps, so just keep track of the gaps when
adding holds.  The result appears to be about 43.05.

Extra Credit
------------
Running simulations for extra credit, which involves walking the graph
of holds to see if there is a path between the bottom and the top, results
in about 143.

Rethinking
----------
Given a wall of height H, a maximum distance between holds d, let N(H) be
the average number of holds to be added randomly in order for the wall to
be climbable.

If H < d, then N(H) = 0.

Consider adding a hold at y.

If y < d and y > H - d, then the number of holds added would be 1.

If y < d or y > H - d, then the number holds added would be 1 + H/(H-y)⋅N(H-y)
or 1 + H/y⋅N(y).

If, d < y < H - d, and the number of holds added would be
1 + N(y) + N(H-y).

When H > 2d, integrating over y,

  N(H) = 1 + (1/H)(∫<sub>0</sub><sup>d</sup>dy H/(H-y)⋅N(H-y)
                 + ∫<sub>d</sub><sup>H-d</sup>dy (N(y) + N(H-y))
                 + ∫<sub>H-d</sub><sup>H</sup>dy H/y⋅N(y))

When d < H < 2d, integrating over y,

  N(H) = 1 + (1/H)(∫<sub>0</sub><sup>H-d</sup>dy H/(H-y)⋅N(H-y)
                 + ∫<sub>d</sub><sup>H</sup>dy H/y⋅N(y))

When H < d,

  N(H) = 0

The next step would be to break up the integrals by the ranges of the
argument of N, y or H-y, by whether it is between 0 and d, between d and
2d, or greater than 2d.  But I don't have the insight on to how to solve
the integral equations.
