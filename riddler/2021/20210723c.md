==========================
Resorting to [code](20210723c.go) to run simulations.
There are a maximum of 9 gaps, so just keep track of the gaps when
adding holds.  The result appears to be about 43.05.

Extra Credit
------------
Running simulations for extra credit, which involves walking the graph
of holds to see if there is a path between the bottom and the top, results
in about 143.
