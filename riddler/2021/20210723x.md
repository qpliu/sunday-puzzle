==========================
Based on eyeballing, one path is
* up and left to the pawn
* up and left to the knight
* left twice and down to the queen
* up and right to the knight
* up twice and right to the knight
* right twice and up to the pawn
* up and right to the rook
* left to the king

The king in the upper corner is only reachable by the knight down and
two to the left.  That knight in only reachable by the rook to its left.
That rook is only only reachable by the bishop to its upper left.  That
bishop is only reachable by the knight down and two to the left.  That
knight is only reachable by the rook on its right (already considered)
and the rook down one.  That rook is reachable by the knight down two and
to the left.  That reveals another path
* up and left to the pawn
* up and left to the knight
* right twice and down to the queen
* up and right to the knight
* up twice and left to the rook
* up to the knight
* right twice and up to the bishop
* down and left to the rook
* right to the knight
* left twice and up to the king (or right twice and up to the other king)

The king in the lower corner is not reachable.

The king in the second row is only reachable from the knight down two and
to the left.  That knight is not reachable.

Another path is
* up and left to the pawn
* up and left to the knight
* left twice and down to the queen
* up and right to the knight
* up twice and right to the knight
* left twice and up to the knight
* right twice and up to the bishop
* right and down to the knight
* right twice and up to the rook
* left to the king
