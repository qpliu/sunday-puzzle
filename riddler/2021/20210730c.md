==========================
Link n is at an angle 𝜃<sub>n</sub> = n𝜃, where n=0,1,2...

That means link n+1 starts at
  x<sub>n+1</sub> = x<sub>n</sub> + f<sup>n</sup>cos(n𝜃)
  y<sub>n+1</sub> = y<sub>n</sub> + f<sup>n</sup>sin(n𝜃)

The curve is mapped out by x<sub>∞</sub>(f,𝜃), y<sub>∞</sub>(f,𝜃), for
𝜃 varying from 0 to 2𝜋 and parameterized by f.

Consider select values of 𝜃 to try getting a sense of the curve.

At 𝜃=0, x=1/(1-f), y=0.

At 𝜃=𝜋, x=1/(1+f), y=0.

At 𝜃=𝜋/2, x=1/(1+f<sup>2</sup>), y=f/(1+f<sup>2</sup>).

At 𝜃=3𝜋/2, x=1/(1+f<sup>2</sup>), y=-f/(1+f<sup>2</sup>).

Guessing that it will turn out to be a circle.  If, when expanding
sin(n𝜃) and cos(n𝜃) in terms of powers of sin𝜃 and cos𝜃, and all powers
other than 1 sum to 1 or cancel out, it will be a circle.  I'll try
doing the work later.
