==========================
First consider the simpler case one round, which is what happens if there
is a tie after 3 rounds:

|chance|result     |
|------|-----------|
|1/27  |lose 15-24 |
|1/9   |lose 19-24 |
|1/9   |lose 20-24 |
|1/9   |lose 23-24 |
|2/9   |tie  24-24 |
|1/9   |win  25-24 |
|1/27  |win  27-24 |
|1/9   |win  28-24 |
|1/9   |win  29-24 |
|1/27  |win  30-24 |

There is 10/27 chance of losing, 6/27 chance of tie, and 11/27 chance of
winning after 1 round.  When continuing until ties are broken, the chance
of winning is 11/21 and the chance of losing is 10/21.

Now consider 3 rounds:
|chance    |result     |
|----------|-----------|
|1/19683   |lose 45-72 |
|1/2187    |lose 49-72 |
|1/2187    |lose 50-72 |
|4/2187    |lose 53-72 |
|8/2187    |lose 54-72 |
|4/2187    |lose 55-72 |
|28/6561   |lose 57-72 |
|28/2187   |lose 58-72 |
|28/2187   |lose 59-72 |
|28/6561   |lose 60-72 |
|14/2187   |lose 61-72 |
|56/2187   |lose 62-72 |
|28/729    |lose 63-72 |
|56/2187   |lose 64-72 |
|28/2187   |lose 65-72 |
|70/2187   |lose 66-72 |
|140/2187  |lose 67-72 |
|140/2187  |lose 68-72 |
|238/6561  |lose 69-72 |
|70/2187   |lose 70-72 |
|140/2187  |lose 71-72 |
|560/6561  |tie 72-72  |
|16/243    |win 73-72  |
|28/729    |win 74-72  |
|280/6561  |win 75-72  |
|140/2187  |win 76-72  |
|47/729    |win 77-72  |
|92/2187   |win 78-72  |
|56/2187   |win 79-72  |
|20/729    |win 80-72  |
|631/19683 |win 81-72  |
|19/729    |win 82-72  |
|32/2187   |win 83-72  |
|52/6561   |win 84-72  |
|5/729     |win 85-72  |
|14/2187   |win 86-72  |
|28/6561   |win 87-72  |
|4/2187    |win 88-72  |
|1/2187    |win 89-72  |
|1/19683   |win 90-72  |

There is a 8731/19683 chance of losing, 9272/19683 chance of winning,
and 1680/19683 chance of tie after 3 rounds.

After breaking ties, the chance of losing is 8731/19683 + 1680/19683⋅10/21
and the chance of losing is winning is 9272/19683 + 1680/19683⋅11/21.

So Riddler Nation should be favored with a 376/729 chance of winning
and a 353/729 chance of losing, or about 51.5775% chance of winning.
