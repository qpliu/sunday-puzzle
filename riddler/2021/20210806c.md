==========================
I assume that it is valid to smash into the outer wall a fraction
of a second after finishing.

To start with, I will consider the horizontal and vertical components of
the paths separately.

Considering the horizontal paths, I need to get to at least the 3rd point
left of the start line and no further than the 7th, then turn around
and get to at least the 3rd point right of the start line and no further
than the 7th.  The tightest path would be right (+1), coast (+1), coast (+1),
left (0), left (-1), left (-2), coast (-2), right (-1), right (0),
right (+1), right (+2).  This sets the lower limit at 11 seconds.

Considering the vertical paths, the maximum acceleration path would be
up (+1), up (+2), up (+3), down (+2), down (+1), down (0), down (-1), down
(-2), down (-3), up(-2)/coast(-3)/down(-4).  This sets the lower limit at
10 seconds.

The tightest vertical path would be up (+1), up (+2), coast (+2), coast (+2),
down (+1), down (0), down (-1), down (-2), down (-3).  This sets the lower
limit at 9 seconds.

The horizontal path is more limiting.  The vertical path has more play
for finding a valid 2-dimensional path.

My approach will be to find a valid path by hand as an upper limit, which
can then be used in a computational brute force search of possible move
sequences that move through the lower-right, upper-right, upper-left,
lower-left quadrants in order, then into the lower-right quadrant without
hitting a wall.

It is not possible for a valid path to cross through a quadrant without
landing on a grid point in that quadrant, so checking for passing through
a quadrant only needs checking if I'm on a grid point in that quadrant on
an even second.

Creating a path by hand,
* 3 right-up (+1,+1)
* 5 coast-coast (+1,+1)
* 2 coast-up (+1,+2)
* 4 left-coast (0,+2)
* 4 left-coast (-1,+2)
* 7 left-down (-2,+1)
* 8 coast-down (-2,0)
* 9 right-down (-1,-1)
* 9 right-down (0,-2)
* 5 coast-coast (0,-2)
* 6 right-coast (+1,-2)
* 3 right-up (+2,-1), or 6 right-coast (+2,-2), or 9 right-down (+2,-3)
takes 12 seconds.  That means a brute force search of up to 9<sup>12</sup>
move sequences.

The hand-created path reaches the lower-right quadrant after 0 seconds,
the upper-right quadrant after 3.5 seconds,
he upper-left quadrant after 6 seconds,
and the lower-right quadrant after 9.5 seconds.
These timings can be used to prune wildly off move sequences.
