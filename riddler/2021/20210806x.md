==========================
I assume the probability that the triangles are all the same size is 100%
and the probability that the sides being attached are lined up is 100%.

In all cases, the first three triangles should result in the same 5-side
polygon, with a middle triangle that is attached to the other two triangles
and the other two triangles attached only to the middle triangle.

When forming an open tetrahedral shape with the first three triangles, there
are 3 edges that can be used to attach the last triangle to finish the
tetrahedron, so the answer is 3/5.
