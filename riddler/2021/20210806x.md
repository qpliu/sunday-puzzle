==========================
I assume the probability that the triangles are all the same size is 100%
and the probability that the sides being attached are lined up is 100%.

In all cases, the first three triangles should result in the same 4-side
polygon, with a middle triangle that is attached to the other two triangles
and the other two triangles attached only to the middle triangle, with one
double side formed by 2 triangle sides.

When forming an open tetrahedral shape with the first three triangles, there
are 3 edges that can be used to attach the last triangle to finish the
tetrahedron.  If the double side counts as 2 sides, the answer is 3/5.  If
the double side counts as 1 side, the answer is 3/4.  After considering the
extra credit case with the squares, I'll assume that the double side counts
as 2 sides.

Extra credit

For the squares, the two possibilities for the 3rd square are
* 2/6 cases form a 3×1 I
* 4/6 cases form a 2×2 L

From a 3×1 I, the possibilities for the 4th square are
* 2/8 cases form a 4×1 I
* 4/8 cases form a 3×2 L
* 2/8 cases form a (2+2)×2 T

From a 2×2 L, the possiblities for the 4th square are
* 2/8 cases form a 3×2 L
* 2/8 cases form a 2×2 square, which cannot be folded into a cube
* 2/8 cases form a (2+2)×2 T
* 2/8 cases form a 2×2×2 Z

From a 4×1 I, the possiblities for the 5th square are
* 2/10 cases form a 5×1 I, which cannot be folded into a cube
* 4/10 cases form a 3×2 L
* 4/10 cases form a (3+2)×2 T

From a 3×2 L, the possibilities for the 5th square are
* 1/10 cases forms a 3×3 L, which cannot be folded into a cube
* 2/10 cases form a 2×2 square plus an extra piece, which cannot be folded into a cube
* 1/10 cases forms a U, which cannot be folded into a cube
* 1/10 cases forms a 4×2 L
* 1/10 cases forms a 2×3×2 Z
* 1/10 cases forms a hybrid of 3×2 L and a (2+2)×2 T, or an LT hybrid
* 1/10 cases forms a (2+2)×3 T
* 1/10 cases forms a (2+3)×2 T
* 1/10 cases forms a 2×2×3 Z

From a (2+2)×2 T, the possiblities for the 5th square are
* 4/10 cases form a 2×2 square plus an extra piece, which cannot be folded into a cube
* 2/10 cases form a (2+3)×2 T
* 2/10 cases form an LT hybrid
* 1/10 cases forms a +
* 1/10 cases forms a (2+2)×3 T
  
From a 2×2×2 Z, the possiblities for the 5th square are
* 4/10 cases form a 2×2 square plus an extra piece, which cannot be folded into a cube
* 2/10 cases form a 2×2×3 Z
* 2/10 cases form a W
* 2/10 cases form an LT hybrid

The 5-square shapes are
* 3×3 L - 0 chance for a cube
* 2×2 square plus an extra piece - 0 chance for a cube
* U - 0 chance for a cube
* 4×2 L - 4/12 chance for a cube
* 2×3×2 Z - 4/12 chance for a cube
* LT hybrid - 4/12 chance for a cube
* (2+2)×3 T - 4/12 chance for a cube
* (2+3)×2 T - 4/12 chance for a cube
* 2×2×3 Z - 4/12 chance for a cube
* + - 4/12 chance for a cube
* W - 4/12 chance for a cube

Working back to the 4-square shapes
* 4×1 I - 4/5×1/3 = 4/15 chance for a cube
* 3×2 L - 3/5×1/3 = 3/15 chance for a cube
* (2+2)×2 T - 3/5×1/3 = 3/15 chance for a cube
* 2×2 square - 0 chance for a cube
* 2×2×2 Z - 3/5×1/3 = 3/15 chance for a cube

Working back to the 3-square shapes
* 3×1 I - 1/4×4/15 + 1/2×3/15 + 1/4×3/15 = 13/60 chance for a cube
* 2×2 L - 1/4×3/15 + 1/4×3/15 + 1/4×3/15 = 9/60 chance for a cube

So the total chance for a cube is 1/3×13/60 + 2/3×9/60 = 31/180.

I don't want to think about the remaining three solids.
