==========================
Let S(N) be the maximum expected score from N dice.

After rolling with N dice, let D_1, D_2, D_3... be the largest, second largest,
third largest... rolls of the N dice.
```
  S(N,D_1,D_2,D_3,...) = maximum of
            D_1 + S(N-1)
	    D_1 + D_2 + S(N-2)
	    D_1 + D_2 + D_3 + S(N-3)
	    ...
```
Then sum S(N,D_1,D_2,D_3,...) over the possible D_1, D_2, D_3... weighted by
their probabilities, P(D_1,D_2,D_3,...) to get S(N),
```
  S(N) = sum P(D_1,D_2,D_3,...)S(N,D_1,D_2,D_3,...)
```

Start from 1:
```
  S(1) = 21/6
```

Continue to 2:
```
  S(2,1,1) = 1 + S(1) = 27/6
  P(1,1) = 1/36
  S(2,2,1) = 2 + S(1) = 33/6
  P(2,1) = 2/36
  S(2,2,2) = 2 + S(1) = 33/6
  P(2,2) = 1/36
  S(2,3,1) = 3 + S(1) = 39/6
  P(3,1) = 2/36
  S(2,3,2) = 3 + S(1) = 39/6
  P(3,2) = 2/36
  S(2,3,3) = 3 + S(1) = 39/6
  P(3,3) = 1/36
  S(2,4,1) = 4 + S(1) = 45/6
  P(4,1) = 2/36
  S(2,4,2) = 4 + S(1) = 45/6
  P(4,2) = 2/36
  S(2,4,3) = 4 + S(1) = 45/6
  P(4,3) = 2/36
  S(2,4,4) = 4 + 4 = 8
  P(4,4) = 1/36
  S(2,5,1) = 5 + S(1) = 51/6
  P(5,1) = 2/36
  S(2,5,2) = 5 + S(1) = 51/6
  P(5,2) = 2/36
  S(2,5,3) = 5 + S(1) = 51/6
  P(5,3) = 2/36
  S(2,5,4) = 5 + 4 = 9
  P(5,4) = 2/36
  S(2,5,5) = 5 + 5 = 10
  P(5,5) = 1/36
  S(2,6,1) = 6 + S(1) = 57/6
  P(6,1) = 2/36
  S(2,6,2) = 6 + S(1) = 57/6
  P(6,2) = 2/36
  S(2,6,3) = 6 + S(1) = 57/6
  P(6,3) = 2/36
  S(2,6,4) = 6 + 4 = 10
  P(6,4) = 2/36
  S(2,6,5) = 6 + 5 = 11
  P(6,5) = 2/36
  S(2,6,6) = 6 + 6 = 12
  P(6,6) = 1/36

  S(2) = 593/72 or about 8.236
```
Resorting to super slow [code](20210813c.hs) that could no doubt be
significantly faster if I knew combinatorics,

S(3) = 13049/972 or about 13.425
S(4) = 989065/52488 or about 18.844
S(5) = takes too long to calculate
