==========================
With one other random person, the probability is
```
   10\int_{9/10}^1 dx \int_0^1 dy H(x-y) =
   10\int_{9/10}^1 dx \int_0^x dy =
   10\int_{9/10}^1 dx x = 19/20
```
With two other random people, the probability is
```
   10\int_{9/10}^1 dx \int_0^1 dy H(x-y) \int_0^1 dz H(x-z) =
   10\int_{9/10}^1 dx \int_0^x dy \int_0^x dz =
   10\int_{9/10}^1 dx x^2 = 271/300
```
With nine other random people, the probability is
```
   10\int_{9/10}^1 dx x^9 = 612579511/900000000 \approx 68.0644%
```

Oops, did the integral wrong, it should be
```
   10\int_{9/10}^1 dx x^9 = 6513215599/10000000000 \approx 65.132%
```
