==========================
After any given first jump, the distribution of the results of the second
jump is a circle with a 1 ft radius that is centered 1 ft from the starting
position in the direction of the first jump.

Since the distance is independent of the direction of the first jump, it
is solely dependent on the direction of the second jump, 𝜃, which is
uniformly distributed from 0 to 2𝜋, or P(𝜃) = 1/2𝜋.

The distance r² = (1+cos𝜃)² + sin²𝜃 = 2 + 2cos𝜃.

𝜃 is uniformly distributed, but r is not.

dr/d𝜃 = 0 at 𝜃 = 0 and 𝜃 = 2𝜋, so the distribution of r is most dense
around 𝜃 = 0 and 𝜃 = 2𝜋, so r = 2 must be the most probable distance.
