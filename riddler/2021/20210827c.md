==========================
Let v be returner's speed, 15mph, or 22/3 yds/sec, so the returner's
location is (vt,0) and would score in 300/22 seconds, or about 13.64 seconds.

Let (0,y₀) be my initial location, where y₀ = 50 yds.  Let s be my speed.

The differential equations for my location are
```
  dx/dt = s(vt-x)/√((x-vt)²+y²)
  dy/dt = -sy/√((x-vt)²+y²)
```
or, assuming x ≤ vt, since the initial trajectory will be toward the
sideline,
```
  dx/dt = s/√(1+y²/(x-vt)²)
  dy/dt = -s/√(1+(x-vt)²/y²)
```

An upper bound for s is running 150 yards in 300/22 seconds, or 22.5mph.
A lower bound is running 50√5 yards in 300/22 seconds, or about 16.77mph.

Since I don't know a closed-form solution, I'll use [code](20210827c.hs) to
find a numerical solution by doing a simple-minded finite differencing for
about 13.64 seconds, and then doing a binary search for s that results in
catching the returner at a time closest to 300/22 seconds.

Numerically, I find that 9.3667 yds/s, or 19.1592 mph, is the approximate
minimum speed.

Analytical approach
-------------------
Let r = √((vt-x)²+y²), tan𝜃 = (vt-x)/y.
The initial conditions are r = y₀, 𝜃 = 0.
```
    dr/dt = 1/2r (2(vt-x)(v-dx/dt)+2y dy/dt)
    sec²𝜃 d𝜃/dt = (v - dx/dt)/y + (vt-x)/y² dy/dt

    dx/dt = s sin𝜃
    dy/dt = -s cos𝜃

    dr/dt = v sin𝜃 - s
    sec²𝜃 d𝜃/dt = (v - s sin𝜃)/y - s(vt-x)/y² cos𝜃
                = (v - s sin𝜃 - s tan𝜃 cos𝜃)/rcos𝜃
    d𝜃/dt = cos𝜃 (v - 2s sin𝜃) / r
          = (v cos𝜃 - s sin2𝜃)/r
```
𝜃 should be monotonically increasing until r reaches 0.
```
   r dr/d𝜃 = (v sin𝜃 - s) / (v cos𝜃 - s sin2𝜃)

   r²/2 - y₀²/2 = \int_0^𝜃 d𝜃 (v sin𝜃 - s) / (v cos𝜃 - 2s sin𝜃 cos𝜃)
                = \int d𝜃 (v tan𝜃 - s sec𝜃) / (v - 2s sin𝜃)

   r² = y₀² + 2 \int d𝜃 (v tan𝜃 - s sec𝜃) / (v - 2s sin𝜃)
```
If I can find a closed-form solution for r in terms of 𝜃, then I can solve
for 𝜃₁, which is 𝜃 at r = 0, then substituting the solution for r in terms
of 𝜃 in d𝜃/dt, integrating and from 0 to 𝜃₁ to get t₁, the time it takes to
catch the returner in terms of y₀, v and s.  Then, solve for s in term of y₀,
v, and t₁.  Then, plugging in y₀ = 50 yds, v = 15 mph = 22/3 yds/sec,
t₁ = 300/22 secs would give the answer.
