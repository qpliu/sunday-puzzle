==========================
Let v be returner's speed, 15mph, or 22/3 yds/sec, so the returner's
location is (vt,0) and would score in 300/22 seconds, or about 13.64 seconds.

Let (0,y₀) be my initial location, where y₀ = 50 yds.  Let s be my speed.

The differential equations for my location are
```
  dx/dt = s(vt-x)/√((x-vt)²+y²)
  dy/dt = -sy/√((x-vt)²+y²)
```
or, assuming x ≤ vt, since the initial trajectory will be toward the
sideline,
```
  dx/dt = s/√(1+y²/(x-vt)²)
  dy/dt = -s/√(1+(x-vt)²/y²)
```

An upper bound for s is running 150 yards in 300/22 seconds, or 22.5mph.
A lower bound is running 50√5 yards in 300/22 seconds, or about 16.77mph.

Since I don't know a closed-form solution, I'll use [code](20210827c.hs) to
find a numerical solution by doing a simple-minded finite differencing for
about 13.64 seconds, and then doing a binary search for s that results in
catching the returner at a time closest to 300/22 seconds.

Numerically, I find that 9.3667 yds/s, or 19.1592 mph, is the approximate
minimum speed.
