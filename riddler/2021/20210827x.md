==========================
I assume my friends also try to maximize their expected points.

Assuming each person drafts the best available player at a position, there
are 54 possible draft orders to consider.  A's first pick has 3 choices,
B's first pick has 3 choices, C's first two picks has 3 choices, B's second
pick has 2 choices, and the remaining choices are set.

Intuitively, I'd think A takes RB first, B takes QB, C takes QB and WR, B
takes WR, A takes QB and WR, B takes RB, C takes RB, giving A 775 points,
B 850 points, and C 800 points, making B the best draft position.

Using [code](20210827x.hs), it looks like A gets 775 points no matter if
A picks QB, RB, or WR.  If A picks RB first, B gets 850 and C gets 800,
otherwise B and C both get 825, so B is the best draft position.
