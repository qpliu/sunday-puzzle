==========================
In the [earlier case](20210528c.md), there were two equilateral triangles
joined at one edge to form two sides of a tetrahedron, and the angle at
which the two equilateral triangles are joined maximizes the volume of the
tetrahedron.

In this case, the two equilateral triangles are replaced by two
identical isosocles triangles, so there are two variables over which to
maximize the volume of the tetrahedron.

Let two of the vertices be at (0,w/2,0) and (0,-w/2,0).

The other two vertices are at (L/2,0,h) and (-L/2,0,h).

That makes the lengths of two of the edges w and L.  For the lengths
of the other 4 edges to be 1, L²/4 + w²/4 + h² = 1.

The area of the rectangular cross-sections as a function of z is
z(1 - z/h)wL/h, and integrating over z from 0 to h gives the volume
V = wLh/6.

Maximizing V,
```
  ∂V/∂w = Lh/6 + wL/6 ∂h/∂w = 0
  ∂V/∂L = wh/6 + wL/6 ∂h/∂L = 0

  ∂h/∂w = -w/4h
  ∂h/∂L = -L/4h

  4h² = w²
  4h² = L²
```
So w = L and h = √(1-L²/2), and V = L²/6 √(1-L²/2).
```
  dV/dL = L/3 √(1-L²/2) - L³/(12√(1-L²/2)) = 0

  4(1-L²/2) - L² = 0

  3L² = 4
```
w = L = 2/√3, h = 1/√3 and V = 2/√243 = 2/9√3, or about 0.1283, which is
a little larger than 1/8.

Correction
----------
That was not correct.  There was another way to make a tetrahedron with
4 edges of length 1, which was to have 2 isosocles triangles and 1 equilateral
triangle as its faces, where the sides of the equilateral triangle have
length 1 and the 2 isosocles triangles have 2 sides of length 1 and the
remaining face has 1 side of length 1, and will turn out to be isosocles.
