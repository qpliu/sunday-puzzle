==========================
Consider the circle circumscribing the polygon.

If the polygon is an n-gon with with a side of length 2, the
radius of the circle is r = 1/sin(𝜋/n).

The diagonals of interest are chords of the circle.
The angles of the endpoints of the chords from the endpoint of the first
diagonal are 2𝜋k/n.  The chords intersect the segment at
y = r cos(2𝜋k/n), where y = r at one end of the segment, y = 0
at the center of the polygon, and y = -r when n is even and y = -r cos(𝜋/n)
when n is odd at the opposite end of the segment.

The lengths of the pieces are L<sub>k</sub> = r(cos(2𝜋k/n) - cos(2𝜋(k+1)/n)),
where 0 ≤ k < n/2.

The answer is
```
  ∏<sup>k=0</sub><sup>⌊n/2⌋-1</sup>L<sub>k</sub>
```

Using [code](20210917c.hs) to do a brute-force calculation subject to
a bunch of roundoff error, gives 2.000 for n = 1000 and 31.639 for n = 1001.

The lengths could also be written
```
  L<sub>k</sub> = r/2 (e<sup>2𝜋ik/n</sup> + e<sup>-2𝜋ik/n</sup> - e<sup>2𝜋i(k+1)/n</sup> - e<sup>-2𝜋i(k+1)/n</sup>).
```

Let f = e<sup>2𝜋i/n</sup>, then
```
  L<sub>k</sub> = r/2 (f<sup>k</sup> + f<sup>-k</sup> - f<sup>k+1</sup> - f<sup>-k-1</sup>)
```

The product is r<sup>⌊n/2⌋</sup> multiplied by a polynomial in f, where, due
to symmetry, the coefficient for f<sup>k</sup> is equal to the coefficient for
f<sup>-k</sup>, turning it into a sum of cosines of multiples of 2𝜋/n with
various coefficients.

Using the [code](20210917c.hs) to calculate the product of the polynomials
for n = 1000 and n = 1001 is too slow.

There must be some way to show that the product is 2 when n is even and
some closed form expression for the product when n is odd, but I give up.
