==========================
Based on the waffle batter story, I'm guessing that the sequence is the
number of additional squares of a uniform grid that are at least partially
contained by a circle of an increasing radius.

Let the squares be 2×2.

A circle of radius 1 centered at the center of a square would be contained
in one square.

A circle of radius 2 would be contained in 9 squares.

A circle of radius 3 would be contained in 9 squares.

This guess has to be wrong, since, when increasing the radius by 1, every
other increase would add at least 4 squares, and the sequence has consecutive
zeroes.

Maybe the area of the circle is increasing by a constant amount with each
step.

A circle of area 𝜋 centered at the center of a square would contained in
1 square.

A circle of area 2𝜋 would be contained in 5 squares.

A circle of area 3𝜋 would be contained in 9 squares.

A circle of area 4𝜋 would be contained in 9 squares.

Circles of area 5𝜋 - 9𝜋 would be contained in 9 squares.

This guess is also wrong.

I give up for now.
