==========================
Based on the waffle batter story, I'm guessing that the sequence is the
number of additional squares of a uniform grid that are at least partially
contained by a circle of an increasing radius.

Let the squares be 2×2.

A circle of radius 1 centered at the center of a square would be contained
in one square.

A circle of radius 2 would be contained in 9 squares.

A circle of radius 3 would be contained in 9 squares.

This guess has to be wrong, since, when increasing the radius by 1, every
other increase would add at least 4 squares, and the sequence has consecutive
zeroes.

Maybe the area of the circle is increasing by a constant amount with each
step.

A circle of area 𝜋 centered at the center of a square would contained in
1 square.

A circle of area 2𝜋 would be contained in 5 squares.

A circle of area 3𝜋 would be contained in 9 squares.

A circle of area 4𝜋 would be contained in 9 squares.

Circles of area 5𝜋 - 9𝜋 would be contained in 9 squares.

This guess is also wrong.

Maybe the increasing circle radius follows the intersections in a 1×1 grid
ordered by distance.

The grid intersection sequence would be (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2),
(3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (3,3), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (4,4),
(5,3), ...

The radius sequence would be 1, √2, 2, √5, 2√2, 3, √10, √13, 4, √17, 3√2, 2√5,
5, √26, √29, 4√2, √34, ...

The area sequence would be 𝜋, 2𝜋, 4𝜋, 5𝜋, 8𝜋, 9𝜋, 10𝜋, 13𝜋, 16𝜋, 17𝜋, 18𝜋, 20𝜋,
25𝜋, 26𝜋, 29𝜋, 32𝜋, 34𝜋, ...

The sequence of 2×2 squares at least partially contained would be 1, 5, 9,
9, 9, 9, 13, 21, 21, 21, ...

So the sequence of additional 2×2 squares would be 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 0,
0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, ...

This seems closer, but still wrong.

I give up for now.
