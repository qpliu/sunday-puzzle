==========================
The first condition means the length is a multiple of 2.

The second condition means the length is a multiple of 3.

That means the length must be a multiple of 6.

The last condition means each ranger will switch 3 times on average
every 6 weeks, which means a length 6 means either some rangers will
switch 2 (or 0) times and some will switch 4 (or 6) times in 6 weeks,
or some rangers will switch odd number of times in 6 weeks, both of which
mean the length must be a multiple of 12 to satisfy the third condition.

Using [code](20211001c.hs) that found 3200 12-week schedules, one example
is
```
 ab cd
 bc ad
 cd ab
 ad bc
 bd ac
 ad bc
 ac bd
 cd ab
 bc ad
 bd ac
 ab cd
 ac bd
```
I also note that in every one of the 3200 schedules, each ranger is paired
with each other ranger in each location twice -- there are no schedules in
which a ranger is paired with another ranger 4 times in one location and
no times in the other, or 3 times in one location and once in the other.
