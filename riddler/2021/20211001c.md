==========================
The first condition means the length is a multiple of 2.

The second condition means the length is a multiple of 3.

That means the length must be a multiple of 6.

The last condition means each ranger will switch 3 times on average
every 6 weeks, which means a length 6 means either some rangers will
switch 2 (or 0) times and some will switch 4 (or 6) times in 6 weeks,
or some rangers will switch odd number of times in 6 weeks, both of which
means the length must be a multiple of 12 to satisfy the third condition.

Here is an example of a 48-week schedule:
```

I couldn't find a 12-week, 24-week, or 36-week schedule by hand.
