==========================
The minimum average power is zero.  All the turns could be done under zero
resistance, then the resistance could be turned up while the cadence is
zero.

Thinking about the maximum average power, the resistance and cadence need
to be maximized at the same time.  If they are both constants, then it's
160W.  If they are both delta functions, then it's 160W if they peak at
the same time, otherwise, it's zero.  Since all resistance and cadence
curves can be a sum of delta functions, if the resistance and cadence
follow the same curve differing only by some constant factor, the average
power is 160W, and if they have other differences, the average power is
less, so the maximum average power is 160W.
