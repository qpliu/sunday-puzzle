==========================
To maximize the average power, the resistance and cadence would have be
at their greatest at the same time and least at the same time.  For example,
the resistance is 20 for the first 15 minutes, then 60 for the last 15
minutes, and the cadence is 60 for the first 15 minutes, then 100 for the
last 15 minutes, making the power 60W for the first 15 minutes and 300W
for the last 15 minutes, making the maximum average power 180W.

To minimize the average power, the resistance and cadence would have to be
at their greatest when the other is at their least, so for the first 15
minutes, the resistance is 20, the cadence is 100, and the power is 100W,
and for the last 15 minutes, the resistance is 60 and the cadence is 60,
and the power is 180W, making the minimum average power 140W.
