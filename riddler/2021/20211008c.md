==========================
Polar coordinates would be an apt choice.

If your position is (100r,𝜃), the doppelgänger's position is (100R,𝜃+𝜋).

The initial conditions are
```
  r = √2
  R = √2
  𝜃 = -𝜋/4
```

If the doppelgänger always moves at precisely twice my speed,
```
  4ṙ² + 4r²𝜃̇² = Ṙ² + R²𝜃̇²
```

Since you stay on the road,
```
 r = 1/cos𝜃
 ṙ = -sin𝜃/cos²𝜃 𝜃̇
```

Substituting,
```
  (4sec⁴𝜃 - R²)𝜃̇̇² = Ṙ²
  (dR/d𝜃)² = 4sec⁴𝜃 - R²
```
If you could walk backwards and forwards and did so many times, then
at 𝜃 = ±𝜋/4, the maximum R would be 4, corresponding to 400ft, beyond
which the doppelgänger would have to move faster than twice your speed
to remain opposite the lamppost.  But that doesn't answer the riddler,
since you walked only forwards.

I suspect that I'll resort to integrating the differential equation
numerically, but first, consider some bounds.

If the doppelgänger moved 400ft in a straight line, it would start
at x = a, y = a and end at x = -d/√2 and y = d/√2, where a = 100ft
and d is the final distance from the lamppost, then
```
  (d/√2+a)² + (d/√2-a)² = 16a²
  d² + 2a² = 16a²
  d = a√14, or approximately 374ft
```
which is less than 400ft.

At 𝜃 = 0, the maximum R would be 2, corresponding to 200ft, beyond which
the doppelgänger would have to move faster than twice your speed
to remain opposite the lamppost.  I suspect that the doppelgänger moves
through that point, x = 0, y = 200ft, when they've gone a total distance
of 200ft.
