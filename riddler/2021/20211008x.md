==========================
Your profit is p = nw/(n+t) - n, where w = $10,000,000 is the winnings and
n is the number of tickets you buy, and t = 10 is the number of other
winning tickets.

To maximize your profit
```
  dp/dn = w/(n+t) - nw/(n+t)² - 1 = 0
  (n+t)² - w(n+t) + nw = 0
  n² + 2tn + t² - wt = 0
  n = -t ± √(wt)
```
giving n = -10 + √100000000 = 9990 tickets for a profit of $999 per ticket,
or a total profit of $9,980,010.
