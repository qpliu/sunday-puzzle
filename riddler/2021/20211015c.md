2021-10-15 Riddler Classic
==========================
It looks like the number of possibilities is small enough for a
[brute force calculation](20211015c.hs), and the result is 29/32
where the strategy is to pick one team for games 1-4, the other team
for games 5-6, and it doesn't matter for game 7.

------------
The difference I see is that for a closeout game, i.e. when the series
is 3-0, 3-1, or 3-2, I should predict that the team leading the series
wins so that I will either get a correct prediction or I will get another
chance to get a correct prediction.

Similar reasoning applies to when one team has a series lead, i.e. 1-0,
2-0, 2-1, I should predict that the team leading the series wins so that
I will either get a correct prediction or I will have more chances on
average at getting a correct prediction.  And the alternative is either
getting a correct prediction with more additional chances on average
or getting an incorrect prediction with fewer additional chances on
average.

If the series is tied, i.e. 0-0, 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, I don't see how the
prediction matters, so arbitrarily pick the first team.

With this strategy, the result is 119/128.
