==========================
One team always wins game 1, so the answer is 1 plus the number of
games in a 6 game series in which one team has a 1-0 lead, since it doesn't
matter which team has the lead when both teams are equally likely to win
each game
```
  g(0-0) = 1 + g(1-0) = 1 + 103/16 = 93/16 = 5 13/16
```

Game 2
```
  g(1-0) = 1 + ½g(2-0) + ½g(1-1) = 1 + 7/4 + 33/16 = 77/16
```

Game 3
```
  g(2-0) = 1 + ½g(3-0) + ½g(2-1) = 1 + 15/16 + 25/16 = 56/16 = 7/2
  g(1-1) = 1 + g(2-1) = 1 + 25/8 = 33/8
```

Game 4
```
  g(3-0) = 1 + ½g(3-1) = 1 + 7/8 = 15/8
  g(2-1) = 1 + ½g(3-1) + ½g(2-2) = 1 + 7/8 + 5/4 = 25/8
```

Game 5
```
  g(3-1) = 1 + ½g(3-2) = 1 + 3/4 = 7/4
  g(2-2) = 1 + g(3-2) = 1 + 3/2 = 5/2
```

Game 6
```
  g(3-2) = 1 + ½g(3-3) = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2
```

Game 7
```
  g(3-3) = 1
```

Backsubstitution gives g(0-0) = 93/16 = 5 13/16 games on average.
