==========================
If there are _exactly_ two traitors, there are six possible cases.

Tabulating the truthfulness of the statements in the cases,
|traitors|J|W|G|D|
|--------|-|-|-|-|
|JW      |F|F|T|T|
|JG      |F|T|T|T|
|JD      |F|T|T|T|
|WG      |T|F|T|T|
|WD      |T|F|T|F|
|GD      |T|T|F|T|

The only consistent cases are JW and WD, so only Wellington can be
determined to be one of the traitors.
