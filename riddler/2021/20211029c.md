==========================
Let the number of competitors being eliminated from n pairs of squares on
average be b(n).  The first competitor has a 1/2 chance of surviving the
first pair and 1/2 chance of being eliminated,
```
  b(n) = b(n-1)/2 + (1 + b(n-1))/2 = 1/2 + b(n-1)
```
And b(0) = 0, so b(18) = 9, assuming an infinite number of competitors.
But if there are only 16 competitors, then at most 16 can be eliminated,
so 9 is an upper limit, and we expect the number of surviving
competitors on average to be more than 7.

Let S(n,m) be the number of surviving competitors on average when there are
n unknown pairs of squares with m competitors.
```
  S(n,m) = S(n-1,m)/2 + S(n-1,m-1)/2
```
Since everyone remaining survives when all the pairs are revealed,
```
  S(0,m) = m
```
And when there are no survivors,
```
  S(n,0) = 0
```

Working through the matrix,
```
  S(1,m) = S(0,m)/2 + S(0,m-1)/2 = m/2 + (m-1)/2 = (2m-1)/2, when m > 0
  S(1,0) = 0

  S(2,m) = S(1,m)/2 + S(1,m-1)/2 = (2m-1)/4 + (2m-3)/4 = m-1, when m > 1
  S(2,1) = S(1,1)/2 + S(1,0)/2 = 1/4
  S(2,0) = 0

  S(3,m) = S(2,m)/2 + S(2,m-1)/2 = (m-1)/2 + (m-2)/2 = (2m-3)/2, when m > 2
  S(3,2) = S(2,2)/2 + S(2,1)/2 = 1/2 + 1/8 = 5/8
  S(3,1) = S(2,1)/2 + S(2,0)/2 = 1/8
  S(3,0) = 0

  S(4,m) = S(3,m)/2 + S(3,m-1)/2 = (2m-3)/4  + (2m-5)/4 = m-2, when m > 3
  S(4,3) = S(3,3)/2 + S(3,2)/2 = 3/4 + 5/16 = 17/16
  S(4,2) = S(3,2)/2 + S(3,1)/2 = 5/16 + 1/16 = 3/8
  S(4,1) = S(3,1)/2 + S(3,0)/2 = 1/16
  S(4,0) = 0

  S(5,m) = S(4,m)/2 + S(4,m-1)/2 = (m-2)/2 + (m-3)/2 = (2m-5)/2, when m > 4
  S(5,4) = S(4,4)/2 + S(4,3)/2 = 2/2 + 17/32 = 49/32
  S(5,3) = S(4,3)/2 + S(4,2)/2 = 17/32 + 3/16 = 23/32
  S(5,2) = S(4,2)/2 + S(4,1)/2 = 3/16 + 1/32 = 7/32
  S(5,1) = S(4,1)/2 + S(4,0)/2 = 1/32
  S(5,0) = 0
```
and so on.  Using code,
```haskell
  s :: Rational -> Rational -> Rational
  s n m
    | m <= 0 = 0
    | n <= 0 = m
    | otherwise = s (n-1) m/2 + s (n-1) (m-1)/2
```
gives S(18,16) = 458757/65535 = 7 5/65536, or approximately 7.000076294,
which is indeed more than 7.
