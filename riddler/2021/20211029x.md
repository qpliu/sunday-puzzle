==========================
The volume of a sphere is 4/3 πr³ and its surface area is 4πr², so for
the volume in cubic inches to be equal to the surface area in square inches,
r = 3 inches.

------------
The volume of an n-dimensional hypersphere is
V = π<sup>n/2</sup>r<sup>n</sup>/Γ(n/2+1),
and its surface area is S = 2π<sup>n/2</sup>r<sup>n-1</sup>/Γ(n/2),
so S = Vn/r.
So if Vn/r in inches<sup>n-1</sup> = V in inches<sup>n</sup>,
then r = n in inches.
