==========================
Using brute force [code](2021105c.hs), the first three whole numbers
with the property are 36, 378, and 49600.

Looking at larger numbers (up to 1000000, and a few random ranges up
to 5000000000), it looks like between 7% and 8% have factors that add up to
more than the inch to cm conversion, so I don't see an upper bound.

If I could find a method to construct numbers with the property, that
method might have no upper bound, making an infinite number of numbers with
the property.  But I don't know how to do that.
