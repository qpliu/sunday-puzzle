==========================
Marcia has 1/2ⁱ⁰⁰ chance of having no friends.

I would guess that Marcia would have 50 friends on average.

Any friends Marcia has have 0 chance of having no friends.  Let F be the
number of friends Marcia's friends have.
```
  (1 - 1/2ⁱ⁰⁰)F + 0/2ⁱ⁰⁰ = 50

  F = 50/(1 - 1/2ⁱ⁰⁰)
```
F is slightly more than 50.
