==========================
Marcia has 1/2ⁱ⁰⁰ chance of having no friends.

I would guess that Marcia would have 50 friends on average.

Any friends Marcia has have 0 chance of having no friends.  Let F be the
number of friends Marcia's friends have.
```
  (1 - 1/2ⁱ⁰⁰)F + 0/2ⁱ⁰⁰ = 50

  F = 50/(1 - 1/2ⁱ⁰⁰)
```
F is slightly more than 50.

What I got wrong
----------------
I was calculating the average number of friends the people with at least
one friend have, which is typically averaging over almost 101 people.

I should have been calculating the average number of friends that Marcia's
friends have, which would typically average over about 50 people.  Averaging
over all people,
```
  F + 1/2 = 50
```
where F is the average number of friends who are not Marcia, and 1/2 is
the 50% chance of being friends with Marcia.
