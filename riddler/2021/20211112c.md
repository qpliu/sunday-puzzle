==========================
Consider breaking the stick evenly.  There is a 50% chance of winning $500,000
for expected winnings of $250,000.  That's a lower bound.  In this case,
there are no additional turns.

Consider breaking the stick into t and 1-t where t > 1/2, and presenting the
larger piece.  There is an t chance of winning $1,000,000(1-t) for expected
winnings of $1,000,000(t-t²) there are no additional turns, and maximized
at t = 1/2.

Consider the case where the genie has a stick of length between g and 1 and
you have a stick of length f, where f < 1.  If f < g, then you win nothing.
If f > g and you break it into tf and (1-t)f, where tf > g, you have
(tf-g)/(1-g) chance of winning (1-t)f.  If t < 1/2, then you also have a
(1-tf)/(1-g) chance of another turn where the genie has a stick of length
between tf and 1 and you have a stick of length (1-t)f.

Define t(f,g) as your strategy given the length of your remaining stick and
the lower bound of the length of the genie's stick.

For the first turn,
```
  f₁ = 1
  g₁ = 0

  w₁ = (t₁f₁-g₁)/(1-g₁) (1-t₁)f₁ + (1-t₁f₁)/(1-g₁) w₂
```
For subsequent turns,
```
  wⱼ = (tⱼfⱼ-gⱼ)/(1-gⱼ) (1-tⱼ)fⱼ + (1-tⱼfⱼ)/(1-gⱼ) wⱼ₊₁,   if tⱼfⱼ > gⱼ
  wⱼ = 0,                                                  if tⱼfⱼ ≤ gⱼ

  fⱼ₊₁ = (1-tⱼ)fⱼ
  gⱼ₊₁ = tⱼfⱼ
```

If g < f < 2g, there will be one last turn, since it's not possible for both
tf > g and (1-t)f > g.  In this case, the expected winnings is
```
  w = (tf-g)/(1-g) (1-t)f = (tf-g-ft²+gt)f/(1-g)
```
Maximizing w with respect to t,
```
  dw/dt = f/(1-g) (f+g-2ft) = 0

  t = (f+g)/2f
```
which is the generalization of dividing the stick into half, in other words,
fⱼ₊₁ = (fⱼ+gⱼ)/2.

Substituting,
```
  w = (f-g)²/(4-4g)
```
If this is done for the first turn, then w = 1/4, which is the same as
just dividing the stick in half.

Consider taking up to 2 turns.

For the first turn,
```
  w(1,1,0) = t(1-t) + (1-t) w(2,1-t,t)
```
Then, for the second and last turn, f = 1-t, g = t,
```
  w(2,1-t,t) = (1-2t)²/(4-4t)
```
giving
```
  w(1,1,0) = t(1-t) + (1-2t)²/4
           = t - t² + 1/4 - t + t²
           = 1/4
```
which is the same as just dividing the stick in half to start with.

Consider taking up to 3 turns.

For the first turn,
```
  w(1,1,0) = t₁(1-t₁) + (1-t₁) w(2,1-t₁,t₁)
```
For the second turn,
```
  w(2,1-t₁,t₁) = (t₂(1-t₁)-t₁)/(1-t₁) (1-t₂)(1-t₁) + (1 - (t₂(1-t₁)-t₁)/(1-t₁)) w(3,(1-t₂)(1-t₁), t₂(1-t₁))
               = (t₂-t₁-t₁t₂)(1-t₂) + (1-t₁-t₂(1-t₁)+t₁)/(1-t₁) w((1-t₂)(1-t₁), t₂(1-t₁))
               = (t₂-t₁-t₁t₂)(1-t₂) + (1-t₂+t₂t₁)/(1-t₁) w(3,(1-t₂)(1-t₁), t₂(1-t₁))
```
For the third turn, f = (1-t₂)(1-t₁), g = t₂(1-t₁)
```
  w(3,(1-t₂)(1-t₁), t₂(1-t₁))
        = ((1-t₂)(1-t₁)-t₂(1-t₁))²/(4-4t₂(1-t₁))
        = (1-t₁-t₂+t₁t₂-t₂+t₁t₂)²/(4-4t₂+4t₁t₂)
        = (1-t₁-2t₂+2t₁t₂)²/(4-4t₂+4t₁t₂)
```
Substituting for the expected winnings in the second turn,
```
  w(2,1-t₁,t₁) = (t₂-t₁-t₁t₂)(1-t₂) + (1-t₂+t₂t₁)/(1-t₁) w(3,(1-t₂)(1-t₁), t₂(1-t₁))
               = (t₂-t₁-t₁t₂)(1-t₂) + (1-t₂+t₂t₁)/(1-t₁) (1-t₁-2t₂+2t₁t₂)²/(4-4t₂+4t₁t₂)
               = (t₂-t₁-t₁t₂)(1-t₂) + (1-t₂+t₂t₁)/(1-t₁) (1-t₁-2t₂+2t₁t₂)²/(4-4t₂+4t₁t₂)
```
Substituting back into the expected winnings in the first turn,
```
  w(1,1,0) = t₁(1-t₁) + (1-t₁) ((t₂-t₁-t₁t₂)(1-t₂) + (1-t₂+t₂t₁)/(1-t₁) (1-t₁-2t₂+2t₁t₂)²/(4-4t₂+4t₁t₂))
           = t₁(1-t₁) + (t₂-t₁-t₁t₂)(1-t₁)(1-t₂) + (1-t₁-2t₂+2t₁t₂)²/4
           = t₁-t₁² + (t₂-t₁-t₁t₂)(1-t₁-t₂-t₁t₂) + (1-t₁-2t₂+2t₁t₂)²/4
           = t₁-t₁² + t₂    - t₁    - t₁t₂
	            - t₁t₂  + t₁²   + t₁²t₂
	            - t₂²   + t₁t₂  + t₁t₂²
	            - t₁t₂² + t₁²t₂ + t₁²t₂²
		    + (1-t₁-2t₂+2t₁t₂)²/4
           = t₂ - t₂² - t₁t₂ + 2t₁²t₂ + t₁²t₂²
             + 1/4 + t₁²/4 + t₂² + t₁²t₂²
             - t₁/2 - t₂ + t₁t₂
             + t₁t₂ + t₁²t₂
             + 2t₁t₂²
           = 1/4 - t₁/2 + t₁²/4 + t₁t₂ + 3t₁²t₂ + 2t₁t₂² + 2t₁²t₂²
```
Maximize with respect to t₁,
```
    -1/2 + 2t₁/4 + t₂ + 6t₁t₂ + 2t₂² + 4t₁t₂² = 0
    t₁ = (1/2 + t₂ + 2t₂²)/(1/2 + 6t₂ + 4t₂²)
```
This is getting too messy.  Give up unless I get some insight.
