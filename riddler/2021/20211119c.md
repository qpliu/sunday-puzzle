==========================
Let's call the people N, S, E, and W, where N can see E and W, E can see
N and S, S can see W and E, and E can see S and N.

Each person has 3⁹=19683 possible strategies.  There are 3³⁶ combinations of
strategies, and although symmetries in seating and color permutations make
many of them redundant, it's still not feasible to do a brute-force search.

Restricting the strategies to those that guess each color equally, i.e. in
3 of the 9 cases, means there are only 1680 strategies to consider.

It's also possible to take a pair of strategies, have E and W apply them,
and consider the cases for which E and W do not guess correctly and see
if it's possible for N and S to guess correctly.  There are 2822400 pairs
of strategies to consider, which seems feasible for a brute-force search.

Using [code](20211119c.hs), one solution is
|N |S |E guesses|W guesses|
|--|--|---------|---------|
|R |R |Y        |R        |
|R |Y |R        |B        |
|R |B |B        |Y        |
|Y |R |Y        |B        |
|Y |Y |Y        |Y        |
|Y |B |R        |Y        |
|B |R |R        |R        |
|B |Y |B        |R        |
|B |B |B        |B        |

|E |W |N guesses|S guesses|
|--|--|---------|---------|
|R |R |Y        |B        |
|R |Y |B        |R        |
|R |B |R        |Y        |
|Y |R |R        |B        |
|Y |Y |B        |Y        |
|Y |B |B        |B        |
|B |R |Y        |Y        |
|B |Y |R        |R        |
|B |B |Y        |R        |

The code found 720 solutions, which includes redundancies due to symmetries.
There could others in which a color is guessed in more than 3 cases, but
720 seems like plenty.
