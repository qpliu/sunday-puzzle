==========================
Let's call the people N, S, E, and W, where N can see E and W, E can see
N and S, S can see W and E, and E can see S and N.

Each person has 3⁹ possible strategies.  There are 3³⁶ combinations of
strategies, and although symmetries in seating and color permutations make
many of them redundant, it's still not feasible to do a brute-force search.

Consider if W guesses red if either N or S is red, otherwise W guesses
yellow if either N or S is yellow, otherwise blue.

The cases N sees are
* R R - assume that neither N nor S is red
* R Y - assume that neither N nor S is red
* R B - assume that neither N nor S is red
* Y R - assume that either N or S is red or both are blue
* Y Y - assume that either N or S is red or both are blue
* Y B - assume that either N or S is red or both are blue
* B R - assume that N and S are not both blue
* B Y - assume that N and S are not both blue
* B B - assume that N and S are not both blue

If E uses the same strategy as W, the cases N sees are
* R R - need to cover YY YB BY BB - cannot succeed
* R Y - need to cover BB - guess B
* R B - need to cover YB BY - guess Y and S guesses Y
* Y R - need to cover BB - guess B
* Y Y - need to cover RR RY RB YR BR BB - cannot succeed 
* Y B - need to cover RR RY RB YR BR - guess R and S guesses R
* B R - need to cover YY YB BY - guess Y and S guesses Y
* B Y - need to cover RR RY RB YR BR - guess R and S guesses R
* B B - need to cover RR RY RB YR YY YB BR BY - cannot succeed

If E guesses blue if either N or S is blue, otherwise E guesses yellow
if either N or S is yellow, otherwise red, then the cases N sees are
* R R - need to cover YY YB BY BB - cannot succeed
* R Y - need to cover YB BY BB - guess B and S guesses B
* R B - need to cover YY - guess Y
* Y R - need to cover RY RB YR BR BB - cannot succeed
* Y Y - need to cover RR RB BR BB - cannot succeed 
* Y B - need to cover RR RY YR - guess R and S guesses R
* B R - need to cover RY RB YR YY YB BR BY - cannot succeeed
* B Y - need to cover RR RB YB BR BY - cannot succeed
* B B - need to cover RR RY YR YY - cannot succeed

Using [code](20211119c.hs), I can try various strategies for E and W and
check if N and S can make successful guesses for each case in which E and
W don't make successful guesses.

I haven't come up with any good strategies, but now a brute force search
would have to check only 3ⁱ⁸ combinations of 2 strategies
(minus redundant combinations due to symmetries), which might be on the
edge of being feasible, but I'm doubtful and it's not obvious how to
eliminate redundant combinations.
