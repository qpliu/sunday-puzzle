==========================
The distribution of members at the gym at any given time is M(a) = a.
The 100% attender will always be there and the 0% attender will never
be there.

Integrating the distribution from a to 100% gives
```
  ∫ₐ¹ M da = 1 - a²
```
where a = 50% is my attendance, so the probability that a random
member at the gym visits the gym more than me is 75%.
