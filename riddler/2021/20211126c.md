==========================
Let the hills be H = sin x.

Let x=T be the takeoff point and x=3𝜋-L be the landing point.

Let the jump be J = -ax² + bx + c.

At takeoff and landing, J=H, and to be smooth dJ/dx=dH/dx, and since the
jump must clear the hills, d²H/dx² ≤ d²J/dx² at takeoff and landing (note
that both second derivatives should be negative, so the hill should have a
more negative curvature),
```
  sin T = -aT² + bT + c
  cos T = -2aT + b
 -sin T ≤ -2a

  sin L = -a(3𝜋-L)² + b(3𝜋-L) + c
 -cos L = -2a(3𝜋-L) + b
 -sin L ≤ -2a
```

Since the trajectory of jump is concave down, a > 0, so 0 < T < 𝜋/2.
By symmetry, 0 < L < 𝜋/2.

Given T and a, can solve for L.  The jump distance is 3𝜋 - T - L in units
of 2𝜋 hills.  The constraints on a are that the jump must clear the hill,
2a ≤ sin T, and that the jump is less than 2 hills, or L > -𝜋.

Consider the case L=T,
```
  cos T = -2aT + b
 -cos T = -2a(3𝜋-T) + b

  2 cos T = -4aT + 6𝜋a
  a = cos T / (3𝜋 - 2T)

 -sin T ≤ -2a = -2 cos T / (3𝜋 - 2T)
  2 cos T / (3𝜋 - 2T) - sin T ≤ 0
```
The minimum T satisfying the inequality is approximately 0.2189796,
or about 0.0697𝜋, making the maximum jump approximately 1.4303 hills.

Consider L ≠ T.  Due to symmetry, L > T should be equivalent to L < T, so
if there is a maximum jump with L > T, there should be another maximum jump
with L < T, and they should be equal.  So consider T < L, which means, to
be better than the L=T case, T must be less than approximately 0.0697𝜋,
which means there's a smaller upper limit on a at takeoff, and smaller
a means a flatter trajectory, and starting smaller T means starting from a
steeper slope, which means decreasing T also forces L to decrease.
We already know that at landing at 3𝜋-T is not possible when T is less
than the T=L case, and landing is also not possible when L < 0, so I would
guess that it's not possible to improve on the L=T case.  But I don't know
how to prove it.
