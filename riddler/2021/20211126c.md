==========================
Let the hills be H = sin x.

Let x=T be the takeoff point and x=L be the landing point, where
-𝜋/2 ≤ T ≤ 𝜋/2 and 5𝜋/2 ≤ L ≤ 7𝜋/2.

Let the jump be J = ax² + bx + c.

At the takeoff and landing, J = H and dJ/dx = dH/dx.

That gives
```
  sin T = aT² + bT + c
  cos T = 2aT + b
  sin L = aL² + bL + c
  cos L = 2aL + b
```

Also, since the jump cannot go through a hill, d²H/dx² ≤ d²J/dx² at the
takeoff point and d²H/dx² ≥ d²J/dx² at the landing point,
```
  -sin T ≤ 2a
  -sin L ≥ 2a
```

Since a < 0, sin T > 0, making 0 < T ≤ 𝜋/2, so cos T > 0.  This gives
an upper bound or 7𝜋/2, or 7/4 hills.

First, consider sin T = sin L and cos T = -cos L.  That means L = 3𝜋 - T
and the distance is 3𝜋 - 2T, or 3/2 - T/𝜋 hills.

That would make the jump
```
  J = a(x - T)(x - 3𝜋 + T) + sin T
  dJ/dx = 2ax - 3𝜋a
```
And at takeoff
```
  dJ/dx = 2aT - 3𝜋a = cos T
  -sin T ≤ 2a

  a = cos T / (2T - 3𝜋)
  sin T ≥ -2a = - 2 cos T / (2T - 3𝜋)
  sin T + 2 cos T / (2T - 3𝜋) ≥ 0
```
The minimum T satisfying the inequality is approximately 0.2189796,
or about 0.0697𝜋, making the maximum jump approximately 1.4303 hills.

Now, I have to consider allowing the takeoff and landing to have different
elevations, either finding a larger maximum jump or a proof that can't be
larger.
