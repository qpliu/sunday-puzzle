The two choices that come to mind are either to cut off a tetrahedral corner
(to make it more like a sphere), or cut off triangular prism (to make it
more like a cylinder).

Cutting off a tetrahedron
-------------------------
Consider cutting off a tetrahedron where the cut is x from the corner
along each edge, 0 < x < 1.

The volume of the tetrahedron is x³/6.
The resulting volume is V = 1 - x³/6.

The surface area of the cut is x²√3/2.
The removed surface area is 3x²/2.
The resulting surface area is S = 6 - 3x²/2 + x²√3/2 = 6 - (3-√3)x²/2

```
  S/V = (6 - (3-√3)x²/2)/(1 - x³/6)
```

This has a minimum of approximately 5.9618 at x approximately 0.42536.

Cutting off a prism
-------------------
Consider cutting off a triangular prism where the cut is x from the
corner along the edges, 0 < x < 1.

The volume of the prism is x²/2.

The resulting volume is V = 1 - x²/2.

The surface area of the cut is x√2.
The removed surface area is 2x + x²
The resulting surface area is S = 6 + x√2 - 2x - x² = 6 - (2 - √2)x - x².

```
  S/V = (6 - (2 - √2)x - x²)/(1 - x²/2)
```

This has a minimum of approximately 5.9566 at x approximately 0.14805.

Cutting off the prism gives a better result than the tetrahedron.

Interestingly, the surface area to volume ratio of the sphere with radius 1/2
is 6 and the surface area of volume ratio of the cylinder with radius 1/2 and
height 1 is 6.  However, the sphere volume 𝜋/6 < the cylinder volume 𝜋/4 <
the cube volume 1.
