==========================
There are 11 possible sums.  Enumerating the number of ways to make the
sums,
|sum|ways        |
|---|------------|
|0  |1 - []      |
|1  |1 - [1]     |
|2  |1 - [2]     |
|3  |2 - [12,3]  |
|4  |2 - [13,4]  |
|5  |2 - [14,23] |
|6  |2 - [123,24]|
|7  |2 - [124,34]|
|8  |1 - [134]   |
|9  |1 - [234]   |
|10 |1 - [1234]  |

For each sum, there are two sides, so the number of ways to be balanced at
that sum is the square of the number of ways to make the sum.  Adding up the
number of ways to be balanced over all the sums gives 26.
