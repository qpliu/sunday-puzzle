If I am on the garage floor or the third floor, the possibilities are
|floor   |direction|stops|
|--------|---------|-----|
|my floor|         |6    |
|1 away  |coming   |1    |
|1 away  |going    |5    |
|2 away  |coming   |2    |
|2 away  |going    |4    |
|3 away  |         |3    |

The average number of stops is 3½.

If I am on the first floor or second floor, the possibilities are
|floor              |direction  |stops|
|-------------------|-----------|-----|
|nearest of G or 3  |           |1    |
|my floor           |to middle  |4    |
|my floor           |from middle|2    |
|1 away             |to middle  |1    |
|1 away             |from middle|3    |
|furthest of G or 3 |           |2    |

The average number of stops is 2⅙.

Combining the cases, the average number of stops is 2⅚.

If I am on the garage floor or the top floor, the possibilities are 1 to 2N-2,
for an average of N-½.

If I am on floor i or floor N-i, where i < N/2 there can be 1 to i stops
from either above or below.  There can also be i+1 to 2i stops from one
direction.  From the other direction, there can be i+1 to N-i and N-i+1 to
2N-2-2i stops.  So 1 to 2i stops are doubly weighted in the average and 2i+1
to 2N-2-2i stops are singly weighted.  There are 2N-2 cases and the sum of
the stops in all the cases are (2i+1)i + (2N-1)(N-1), so the average
number of stops is (2i+1)i/(2N-2) + (2N-1)(N-1)/(2N-2).

When N is even, averaging the average number of stops from the garage floor
and floor 1 to floor N/2-1, is
```
  (N-½ + (N/2-1)(2N-1)(N-1)/(2N-2) + ∑(2i+1)i/(2N-2)) / (N/2)
```

When N is odd, averaging the average number of stops from the garage floor
and floor 1 to floor (N-1)/2, is
```
  (N-½ + ((N-1)/2)(2N-1)(N-1)/(2N-2) + ∑(2i+1)i/(2N-2)) / (N+½)
```

I'll skip trying to reduce these expressions (namely the sums over i).
