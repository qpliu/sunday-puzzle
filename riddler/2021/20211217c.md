==========================
I think the key is that if the mole starts on an odd numbered hole, it will
always be in an odd numbered hole every other second, etc.

The sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., 99, 100 will be guaranteed to whack the mole if
it starts on an odd numbered hole.  Then, the sequence 100, 99, 98, ..., 3, 2
will be guaranteed to whack the mole if it starts on an even numbered hole.

That's a maximum of 199 whacks.  I don't know if that's what was discussed in
the video.

The video took a lot longer than I expected and was laced with advertisements.
I don't know how I'd do in an interview situation, but I came up with my
answer in about 10 minutes.

After seeing parts the video, I see that the sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., 99, 100,
2, 3, ... 98, 99 for a maximum of 198 whacks should guarantee whacking the
mole, which is the solution in the video minus a final extraneous whack at
100.

The first whack on hole 100 seems unnecessary, since it would always miss if
the mole started on an even numbered hole and if the mole would have ended up
at hole 100 at 100sec, then the first whack at hole 99 would have gotten it,
so the sequence would be 1, 2, 3, ..., 98, 99, 1, 2, 3, ... 98, 99, which is
still 198 whacks.
