==========================
Let the vertices of the base of the tetrahedron be at (-1,0,0), (1,0,0),
and (0,√3,0).

The apex of the tetrahedron is at (0,1/√3,√(8/3)).

The upper and lower vertices of one of the kites are at (0,0,0)
and (0,1/√3,√(8/3)).

The projection of the other two vertices onto the base are at
(-1/4,√(3/16),0) and (1/4,√(3/16),0).

The triangle formed by the apex of the tetrahedron, the center of
the base of the tetrahedron and one of the vertices of the base of the
tetrahedron have lengths 2, √(8/3), and 2/√3.

Consider the triangle formed by the one of the middle vertices of a kite,
its projection to the base and a vertex of the base of the tetrahedron.
The length of its side on the base is √(3/4), so its lengths are 3/4 that
of the previous triangle, or 3/2, √(3/2), and √(3/4).

That makes the length of the top two edges of the kite 1/2, making the
width of the kite 1/2 and the length of the bottom two edges √(7/4).

That makes half the smallest angle arcsin 1/√28 or arctan 1/√27, or about
0.19 or 10.89°.

So the smallest angle is 2 arcsin 1/√28, or about 0.38 or 21.79°.
