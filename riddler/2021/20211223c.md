==========================
To make use of the 1, take the greatest prime number that is less than or
equal to N.  Then, 1 and the rest of the prime numbers will go to the tax
collector, but the prime numbers that are less than N/2 can be used to take
other numbers.

I don't know if the same thing can be done with multiples of 2, since there
are also powers of 2, but let's try.  If we use the 2 to take greatest number
that is less than or equal to N that is twice a prime number, that would be
wasting the 2, since we are already giving up that prime number and we could
use it to take its double.  But we can use the 2 to work on powers of 2.  If
there are 2 powers of 2, take 4 and give up 2.  If there are 3 powers of 2,
take 8 and give up 2 and 4.  If there are more, take 4 and give up 2 and
iterate with the remaining powers of 2.

Then, working on 3, work on numbers that have factors of 2 and 3, with at least
one factor of 3.  Try to arrange it so that taking the greatest such number
means giving up the number that is one third of it, which means working on 3
before working on 2, in case the greatest such number has only one factor of 3,
and it would be 3/2 the greatest power of 2, which might otherwise use it.
I'll think about how to work on these numbers later, but similar logic would
mean working on the primes in descending order.

So, when working on 5, work on numbers that have factors of 2, 3, and 5, with
at least one factor of 5.  And so on...

I'm resorting to [brute force code](20211223c.hs), even though it will get
really slow when N gets large.  I have to assume that losing all but the
greatest prime number, and similarly for powers of 2, powers of 2 and 3,
powers of 2, 3, and 5, etc, will eventually increasingly limit your take
percentage as N increases.

To make the code a little faster, I'm forcing the first check taken to be the
largest prime number, and only considering taking checks that give up no more
than 2 checks.

40/55, or about 72.7% when N = 10 looks like the best.  You take 6-10, giving
up 1-5.  It's hard to see how you can do better than taking half of all the
checks, and all the checks you take are bigger than the ones you are giving
up, which also happens for N = 2, N = 4, and N = 6.

If you do take all the checks greater than N/2, your percentage is limited to
less than 75% as N gets large.  N has to be even for you to take half of all
the checks.  When N > 10, you are forced to give up prime numbers greater
than N/2, so there probably isn't anything better than N = 10.
