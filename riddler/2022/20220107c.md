==========================
Let 𝛼 = 15°.  Let A = (0,0), B = (1,0), C = (cos𝛼,sin𝛼).

All traversals between AB and AC are straight lines.

Let the path be (1,0) to (x₁,y₁) to (x₂,0) to (x₃,y₃).
```
  y₁ = x₁ tan𝛼
  y₃ = x₃ tan𝛼
```
Let a = tan𝛼.

Consider the third traversal, starting from (x₂,0) to (x₃,ax₃).  The
square of the distance is
```
  (x₃-x₂)² + a²x₃²
```
which is minimized with respect to x₃ when
```
  2(x₃-x₂) + 2a²x₃ = 0
  x₃ = x₂/(1+a²)
```
making the square of the distance
```
    x₂²(1 - 1/(1+a²))² + a²x₂²/(1+a²)²
  = x₂²(1 - 2/(1+a²) + (1+a²)/(1+a²)²)
  = x₂²(1 + (a²-1)/(1+a²))
  = 2a²x₂²/(1+a²)
```

Next, consider the second and third traversals, starting from (x₁,ax₁) going
to (x₂,0) then on to (x₂/(1+a²),ax₂/(1+a²)).  The square of the distance
is
```
  2a²x₂²/(1+a²) + (x₁-x₂)² + a²x₁²
```
which is minimized with respect to x₂ when
```
  4a²x₂/(1+a²) - 2(x₁-x₂) = 0
  x₂(1+3a²)/(1+a²) = x₁
  x₂ = x₁(1+a²)/(1+3a²)
```
making the square of the distance
```
    2a²x₁²(1+a²)/(1+3a²)² + x₁²(1-(1+a²)/(1+3a²))² + a²x₁²
  = x₁²(2a²(1+a²)/(1+3a²)² + ((1+3a²)²-(1+a²))/(1+3a²)² + a²)
  = x₁²(2a²(1+a²)/(1+3a²)² + ((1+3a²)²-(1+a²))/(1+3a²)² + a²)
  = x₁²(2a²+2a⁴+1+6a²+9a⁴-1-a²+a²+6a⁴+9a⁶)/(1+3a²)²
  = x₁²a²(8+17a²+9a⁴)/(1+3a²)²
```

Finally, consider the complete path.  The square of the distance is
```
  x₁²a²(8+17a²+9a⁴)/(1+3a²)² + (x₁-1)² + x₁²a²
```
which is minimized with respect to x₁ when
```
  2x₁a²(8+17a²+9a⁴)/(1+3a²)² + 2(x₁-1) + 2x₁a² = 0
  x₁(a²(8+17a²+9a⁴)/(1+3a²)² + 1 + a²) = 1
  x₁(a²(8+17a²+9a⁴)+(1+a²)(1+3a²)²)/(1+3a²)² = 1
  x₁ = (1+3a²)²/(a²(8+17a²+9a⁴)+(1+a²)(1+3a²)²)
```

When 𝛼 = 15°, a = tan𝛼 is approximately 0.267949.

Plugging that in, x₁ is approximately 0.656940, and the square of the
total distance is approximately 0.343060, making the distance approximately
0.585713.

When 𝛼 = 30°, the distance is approximately 0.866025.

When 𝛼 = 45°, the distance is approximately 0.870388.

When 𝛼 = 60°, the distance is approximately 0.937043.

When 𝛼 = 10°, the distance is approximately 0.449467.

When 𝛼 = 5°, the distance is approximately 0.250805.

When 𝛼 = 1°, the distance is approximately 0.0522662.

In all these cases, 0 < x₁ < cos𝛼, so the paths stay within the triangle.
