==========================
I assume that we will score exactly two touchdowns before the end of
regulation, and the p is the chance of success when going for 2.

The alternative is to kick after the first touchdown.  The possibilities
after that are to kick after the second touchdown with a 50% chance of
winning, or to go for 2 after the second touchdown with a p chance of
winning.

The chance of winning when going for 2 after the first touchdown in
regulation is p, and in overtime after is ½(1-p)p, for a total of
p + ½(1-p)p, which is always greater than p for 0 < p < 1, so it's a
matter of when it's greater than ½, which is when p > (3-√5)/2 or about
38.1966%.
