==========================
It looks like there is no intersection between the 2315 words in Ta and the
10657 words in La.  Words in either Ta or La may be guessed.  When the guess
is "AAHED" and the answer is "TANGY", the first "A" is gray, and the second
"A" is green.  When the guess is "ABASH" and the answer is "TANGY", the first
"A" is yellow and the second "A" is gray.

There are 12972 possible first guesses.

Restricting the first guess to words with 5 unique letters, there are
8322 possible first guesses.

It may be possible that it makes sense to make a second guess with
less than 5 unique letters after some of the first guesses, but I'll neglect
that possibility.

It may be possible that it makes sense to make a second guess that
has one or more letters in common with the first guess, but I'll neglect
that possibility.

There are up to 3‚Åµ = 243 possible results to a first guess.  The most likely
result for most first guesses is probably all five gray.

Using brute force [code](20220114c.hs), which I estimate will take 15-18
hours, an early best first guess is "TRACE" with 1338/2315, or about 57.8%
chance of guessing by the 3rd guess.
