==========================
It looks like there is no intersection between the 2315 words in Ta and the
10657 words in La.  Words in either Ta or La may be guessed.  When the guess
is "AAHED" and the answer is "TANGY", the first "A" is gray, and the second
"A" is green.  When the guess is "ABASH" and the answer is "TANGY", the first
"A" is yellow and the second "A" is gray.

There are 12972 possible first guesses.

Restricting the first guess to words with 5 unique letters, there are
8322 possible first guesses.

It may be possible that it makes sense to make a second guess with
less than 5 unique letters after some of the first guesses, but I'll neglect
that possibility.

It may be possible that it makes sense to make a second guess that
has one or more letters in common with the first guess, but I'll neglect
that possibility.

There are up to 3‚Åµ = 243 possible results to a first guess.  The most likely
result for most first guesses is probably all five gray.

Using brute force [code](20220114c.hs), which I estimate will take 15-18
hours, an early best first guess is "TRACE" with 1338/2315, or about 57.8%
chance of guessing by the 3rd guess.

Oops, I miscalculated.  The brute force search will take 110-120 hours, which
is too slow.

One heuristic for cutting off the search is when the chance of getting
5 grays for the first guess is greater than 300/2315.  With this heuristic,
that makes the estimated time for a brute force search a more feasible
20-25 hours.

And it actually took about 6 hours, and a bug in my code means it should
have taken less than that since it was considering all the words in La rather
than just the ones with 5 unique letters, finding "CRANE" with a 1342/2315, or
about 57.97%, chance of guessing by the 3rd guess.

And it looks like restricting the second guess to 5 distinct letters is
suboptimal.  For example, if first guess "CRANE" results in
Gray,Green,Gray,Yellow,Gray, there are 5 possible words, and using "BIFID"
as the second guess distinguishes between all of them, but the best second
guess with 5 distinct letters is "MIDGY", doesn't distinguish 2 of them,
giving 4/5 chance of getting the word.

It seems the same applies for having letters in common with the first guess.
When considering all 12972 words as possible second guesses with "CRANE"
makes the chance of guessing correctly 1375/2315, or about 59.40%.

With "CRATE" as the first guess, the chance is 1377/2315, or about 59.48%.

With "REACT" as the first guess, the chance is 1339/2315, or about 57.84%.

With "TRACE" as the first guess, the chance is 1388/2315, or about 59.96%.

Maybe it's possible to do better than "TRACE", but the search would take too
long.
