==========================
It looks like an overlapping 6×6 pattern with 90° rotations, which would make
the top left red.

The upper left would correspond to one to the right of the upper right,
one to the right and one down from the lower right, and one down from the
lower left in the 3 rotated patterns.

Each red is the overlap of the corners of 4 of the 6×6 patterns, each at
a different rotation.
