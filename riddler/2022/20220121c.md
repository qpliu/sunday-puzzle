==========================
The side length of 1 makes the radius of the circle also 1.

Let (0,0) be the center of the circle.

The upper two vertices of the large hexagon are at (±1/2,√3/2).

Let the side of the smaller hexagon be a.  Then the upper vertices of the
smaller hexagon are (±a/2,√3/2+a√3).  For them to be on the circle,
```
  a²/4 + 3/4 + 3a + 3a² = 1
  13a² + 12a - 1 = 0
```
The positive root is a = 1/13.

Let the side of the third hexagon be b.  The upper vertices of that hexagon
are (±b/2,(1/2+1/13+b)√3) = (±b/2,(15/26+b)√3).  For them to be on the circle,
```
  b²/4 + 675/676 + 45b/13 + 3b² = 1
  169b² + 675 + 2340b + 2028b² = 676
  2197b² + 2340b - 1 = 0
```
The positive root is (-180 + √32452)/338, or about 4.27179e-4.

Let the side of the fourth hexagon be c.  The upper vertices of that hexagon
are (±c/2,(15/26+b+c)√3).  For them to be on the circle,
```
  c²/4 + 675/676 + 3b² + 3c² + 45b/13 + 45c/13 + 6bc = 1
  169c² + 675 + 2028b² + 2028c² + 2340b + 2340c + 4056bc = 676
  2197c² + (2340 + 4056b)c + 2028b² + 2340b - 1 = 0
```
The positive root is about 1.31695e-8.
