==========================
If we ignore the folding, making three straight cuts in a piece of paper
makes 7 pieces.

When considering the folds, the piece with the corner that was originally the
center would be 1 piece, if we arrange the cuts so that that piece also
includes the two adjacent corners, then all the other pieces would be 4 pieces.

That makes 25 pieces.

Using the same reasoning, if making N cuts in an unfolded square would make
M pieces, and arranging the cuts so that they all go from one side without
any folds to the other side without any folds, the one piece with the
original center would be 1 piece, and all the other pieces would be 4
pieces, making 4M-3 pieces.

Now, the problem is determining how many pieces N cuts in an unfolded
square makes.

If N cuts makes M pieces, then the N+1th cut will intersect N cuts, making
N+1 pieces into 2N+2 pieces, adding N+1 pieces, or
```
  M(1) = 2
  M(N) = M(N-1)+N
```

That makes M = N²/2 + N/2 + 1, so the number of pieces from the folded
square would be 2N² + 2N + 1.
