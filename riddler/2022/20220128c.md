==========================
I assume the problem is how much of the fluid is "old" fluid, i.e. more than 12
months old, which is distinct from the old fluid that is removed, which is
the mix of fluids from the previous month.  Otherwise, the answer is 11/12.

Just before replacing, you have
```
  Tₒ + ∑Tᵢ = 12
```

Just after replacing, you have
```
  11Tₒ/12 + ∑11Tᵢ/12 + T = 12
```
where T = 1.

To be at a fixed point,
```
  Tₒ = 11Tₒ/12 + 11T₁₂/12
  Tᵢ = 11Tᵢ₋₁/12
  T₁ = T = 1

  T₂ = 11/12
  T₃ = (11/12)²
  Tᵢ = (11/12)ⁱ⁻¹
  ...
  T₁₂ = (11/12)ⁱⁱ

  Tₒ = 11Tₒ/12 + (11/12)ⁱ²
     = 11ⁱ²/12ⁱⁱ
     = 3138428376721/743008370688, or about 4.22.
```

Tₒ/12 = 11ⁱ²/12ⁱ² = 3138428376721/8916100448256, or about 35.2%.
