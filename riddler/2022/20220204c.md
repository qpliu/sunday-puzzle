==========================
Let f = 99/100, the fraction not reflected.

I'll start with assuming the each polarizer will change the polarization
angle by the same amount, 𝛼, so that n𝛼 = 𝜋/2, where n is the number of
polarizers.

That means each polarizer transmits f cos(𝜋/2n), and all the polarizers
transmit fⁿcosⁿ(𝜋/2n), which has a maximum of about 0.800 at n=11.
