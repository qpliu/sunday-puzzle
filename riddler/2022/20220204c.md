==========================
Let f = 99/100, the fraction not reflected.

I'll start with assuming the each polarizer will change the polarization
angle by the same amount, 𝛼, so that n𝛼 = 𝜋/2, where n is the number of
polarizers.

That means each polarizer transmits f cos(𝜋/2n), and all the polarizers
transmit fⁿcosⁿ(𝜋/2n), which has a maximum of about 0.800 at n=11.

To consider the possibility of polarizing different angles, let f=1 and n=2.

For the same angle, cos²(𝜋/4) = 1/2 is transmitted.

For different angles, cos(𝛼)cos(𝜋/2-𝛼) = cos𝛼 sin𝛼 = sin(2𝛼)/2 is transmitted,
which is maximized at 𝛼=𝜋/4, suggesting that maximum transmission means equal
angles.

So, now consider two polarizers with angles adding up to a total angle, A.
The transmission is cos(𝛼)cos(A-𝛼).  Maximizing transmission with respect
to 𝛼,
```
    - sin(𝛼)cos(A-𝛼) + cos(𝛼)sin(A-𝛼) = 0
    sin(𝛼)cos(A-𝛼) = cos(𝛼)sin(A-𝛼)
```
which is when 𝛼 = A/2, so maximizing transmission means having equal angles.
