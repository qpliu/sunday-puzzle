==========================
The smallest triply trapezoidal number would need to satisfy three of
```
  n = 2a + 1
  n = 3b + 3
  n = 4c + 6
  n = 5d + 10
```
The first must be odd.

The second must be a multiple of 3.

The third must be even, it can't be satisfied by numbers satisfying the first
two.

The fourth must be a multiple of 5.

Try n = 15,
```
  15 = 7 + 8
  15 = 4 + 5 + 6
  15 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
```

Extra Credit
------------
For quadruply trapezoidal, consider
```
  n = 6e + 15
```
which must be an odd multiple of 3, making it a multiple of 3.  It can be
a multiple 5 if e is a multiple of 5.  Trying e = 5,
```
  45 = 22 + 23
  45 = 14 + 15 + 16
  45 =  7 +  8 +  9 + 10 + 11
  45 =  5 +  6 +  7 +  8 +  9 + 10
```

For quintuply trapezoidal, consider
```
  n = 7f + 21
```
which must be a multiple of 7.  It can be a multiple of 3 if f is a multiple
of 3.  It can be an odd multiple of 3 if f is even.  It can be a multiple of
5 if f+3 is a multiple of 5.  Trying f = 12,
```
  105 = 52 + 53
  105 = 34 + 35 + 36
  105 = 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 23
  105 = 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 20
  105 = 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18
```

For sextuply trapezoidal, consider
```
  n = 8g + 28
  n = 9h + 36
```
The first must be even and is out.

The second must be a multiple of 9, making it a multiple of 3.  It can be a
multiple of 5 if h+4 is a multiple of 5.  It can be a multiple of 7 if
h+4 is a multiple of 7.  Trying h = 31,
```
  315 = 157 + 158
  315 = 104 + 105 + 106
  315 =  61 +  62 +  63 + 64 + 65
  315 =  50 +  51 +  52 + 53 + 54 + 55
  315 =  42 +  43 +  44 + 45 + 46 + 47 + 48
  315 =  31 +  32 +  33 + 34 + 35 + 36 + 37 + 38
```
