==========================
Doing the integrals (multiplying the ranges by 10 since I couldn't find
Unicode superscripts and subscripts for decimal points),
```
    ∫₀¹⁰ dx/10 ∫₁⁸ dy/7 H(y - x)
  = ∫₀¹ dx/10 1 + ∫₁⁸ dx/10 ∫ₓ⁸ dy/7 + ∫₈¹⁰ dx/10 0
  = 1/10 + ∫₁⁸ dx/10 (8-x)/7
  = 1/10 + 64/70 - 64/140 - 8/70 + 1/140
  = 9/20
  = 45%
```
