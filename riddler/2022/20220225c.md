==========================
Let one of the points be (0,0).  Let the other point be (a,b).

A parabola with a vertical line of symmetry passing through (0,0) is
```
  y = C(x-D)² - CD²
```
with a vertex at (D,-CD²).  To pass through (a,b),
```
  b = C(a-D)² - CD²
  b = Ca² - 2aCD
  C = b/(a² - 2aD), unless a = 0 or b = 0
  D = a/2, when b = 0
```
If a = 0, there can be no vertically symmetrical parabola passing through
the two points, unless b = 0, in which case the vertex can be anywhere on
the plane.

If b = 0, the vertex is at (a/2,-Ca²/4), i.e. anywhere on the perpendicular
bisector of the two points.

Otherwise, the vertex would be at y = -bx²/(a² - 2ax), which
asymptotes to y = bx/2a for large |x| and the vertical bisector of the
the points, x = a/2, as x approaches a/2, which looks like a hyperbola.
