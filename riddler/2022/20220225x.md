==========================
Adding an oscillation that is continuous and smooth to 2<sup>x</sup> will
allow it to pass through the 5 points
```
  f = exp(x ln2) + a sin(𝜋x)

  df/dx = ln2 exp(x ln2) + a𝜋 cos(𝜋x)
```

For df/dx < 0 at x = 2,
```
  ln 16 + a𝜋 cos(2𝜋) < 0
  a < -(ln 16)/𝜋, or approximately -0.883
```

We can add an oscillation that cuts off at x = 1 and is 0 and has a slope of 0
at x = 1, so it remains smooth and continuous,
```
  f = exp(x ln2) + a (1 - cos(2𝜋x)) H(x - 1)

  df/dx = ln2 exp(x ln2),                when x < 1
          ln2 exp(x ln2) + 2𝜋a sin(2𝜋x), when x > 1
```
For df/dx > 0 for all x, then for x > 1
```
  ln2 exp(x ln2) + 2𝜋a sin(2𝜋x) > 0
```
Conservatively, that means |a| < (ln4)/2𝜋, or approximately 0.221.

Then,
```
  d²f/dx² = (ln2)² exp(x ln2) + 4𝜋²a cos(2𝜋x)
```
For d²f/dx² < 0 at x = 2,
```
  (2ln2)² + 4𝜋²a cos(4𝜋) < 0
  a < -(ln2)²/𝜋², or approximately -0.0487
```
so that means approximately  -0.221 < a < -0.0487.
