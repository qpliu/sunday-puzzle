==========================
Let 𝜃 be the angle of the turning point at the rim of the base.

When 𝜃 = 0, the minimum distance from the start to the turning point is 1.

When 𝜃 = 𝜋/2, the minimum distance from the turning point to the finish is 2.

My approach will be to get an expression for the minimum distance from the
start to the turning point as a function of 𝜃, and to get an expression for
the minimum distance from the turning point to the finish as a function of 𝜃,
then minimize their sum with respect to 𝜃.

It may be more convenient to use the square of the distance.

The square of the distance from the start to the turning point is
(1-2cos𝜃)² + 4sin²𝜃 = 5 - 4cos𝜃, which checks out being 1² when 𝜃 = 0.

For the distance from the turning point to the finish,
```
  z = √3(2 - r)
  𝜙 = 𝜋/2 - 𝜃 when z = 0, r = 2
  𝜙 = 0 when z = √3, r = 1

  dx = dr sin𝜙 - d𝜙 rcos𝜙
  dy = dr cos𝜙 + d𝜙 rsin𝜙
  dz = -√3 dr

  dl² = dx² + dy² + dz²
      =   dr² sin²𝜙 - 2r dr d𝜙 sin𝜙 cos𝜙 + r² d𝜙² cos²𝜙
        + dr² cos²𝜙 + 2r dr d𝜙 sin𝜙 cos𝜙 + r² d𝜙² sin²𝜙
        + 3 dr²
      = 4 dr² + r² d𝜙²

  dl/dr = -√(4 + (r d𝜙/dr)²)

  l = ∫₁² dr √(4 + (r d𝜙/dr)²)
```
If 𝜃 = 𝜋/2 and 𝜙 = 0, then l = 2, which which checks out.

Finding 𝜙 that minimizes l involves calculus of variations.

Euler-Lagrange equation
```
  d/dr ((1/2) 2r²𝜙'/√(4 + (r 𝜙')²)) = 0
  
  r²𝜙'/√(4 + (r 𝜙')²) = C
  (r²𝜙')² = C²(4 + (r 𝜙')²)
  𝜙'² = 4C²/(r²(C²+r²))
  𝜙' = 2C/(r√(C²+r²))
  𝜙 = 2C ∫₁² dr/r 1/√(C²+r²)
```
where 𝜙(1) = 0 and 𝜙(2) = 𝜋/2 - 𝜃.

I'll give up now because I'm lazy.
