==========================
I'll assume that the three cards must be distinct, i.e. a drawn card
is not shuffled back into the deck for the next draw.

|number|flips |rolls |draws    |
|------|------|------|---------|
|0     |1/8   |8/27  |703/1700 |
|1     |3/8   |12/27 |741/1700 |
|2     |3/8   |6/27  |234/1700 |
|3     |1/8   |1/27  |22/1700  |

Adding up the probability that they are all 0, that they are all 1, that they
are all 2, and that they are all 3 gives 6089/61200, or about 9.95%.
