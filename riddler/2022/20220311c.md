==========================
There are 1296 possible rolls of 4 dice and 330 combinations of 4 numbers from
2 to 12, so a brute-force computation seems feasible.

Using [code](20220311c.hs) shows that choosing 4, 6, 8, and 10 maximizes
the chance of winning at 1264/1296 = 79/81 or about 97.53%.

Choosing 2, 3, 11, and 12 minimizes the chance of winning at 776/1296 = 97/162
or about 59.88%.  Or, choosing numbers outside of the range of 2 to 12 makes
the chance of winning zero.

When choosing 1 number, choosing 7 maximizes the chance of winning at
834/1296 = 139/216 or about 64.35%.

When choosing 2 numbers, choosing 7 and 8 or 6 and 7 at 1083/1296 = 361/432 or
about 83.56%.

When choosing 3 numbers, choosing 6, 7, and 8 maximizes the chance of winning
at 1192/1296 = 149/162 or about 91.98%.
