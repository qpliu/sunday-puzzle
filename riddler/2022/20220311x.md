==========================
To minimize the 10th place score, the top 10 take the top 10 for each task.
That makes 165 total points for the top 10, or an average of 16.5 points
when evenly distributed, making a lower bound of 17 for the minimum 10th
place score.

One example of scores is 5+5+5=15 for first place, 1+9+6=16 for a 3 way tie
for 2nd place, and 2+8+7=17 and 3+4+10=17 for a 6 way tie for 5th place.

Consider if 18 guarantees a top 10.  The top 11 would have at least 198
points, or an average of 18 points.  That guarantees that 18 is in the top 10.

Consider if 19 guarantees a top 10.  That means the top 10 excluding the 19
has a total of at least 179, or an average of 17.9 points.  This could push
the 19 out of the top 10, for example, with

|  |tasks  |total |
|--|-------|------|
| 1| 3+4+10|    17|
| 2| 6+6+6 |    18|
| 3| 2+7+9 |    18|
| 4| 2+5+11|    18|
| 5| 2+5+11|    18|
| 6| 1+7+10|    18|
| 7| 3+5+10|    18|
| 8| 1+9+8 |    18|
| 9| 3+7+8 |    18|
|10| 1+8+9 |    18|
|11| 4+4+11|    19|

So the answer is 18.
