==========================
To minimize the 10th place score, the top 10 take the top 10 for each task.
That makes 165 total points for the top 10, or an average of 16.5 points
when evenly distributed, making a lower bound of 17 for the minimum 10th
place score.

One example of scores is 5+5+5=15 for first place, 1+9+6=16 for a 3 way tie
for 2nd place, and 2+8+7=17 and 3+4+10=17 for a 6 way tie for 5th place.
