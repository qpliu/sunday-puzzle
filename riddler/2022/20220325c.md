Let d be the spacing between the cross sections.

Let h be the distance from the center of the planet to the center of
cross section C.
```
  h² + C² = R²
  (h+d)² + B² = R²
  (h+2d)² + A² = R²
```

To minimize R, take h = 0.
```
  R² = C²
  R² = B² + d²
  R² = A² + 4d²
  B² = A² + 3d²
```

Consider A = 1, which yields B = 13, R = 15 when d² = 56.

Consider A = 2, which yields B = 7, R = 8 when d² = 15.

Consider A = 3, which yields B = 39, R = 45 when d² = 504.

Consider A = 4, which yields B = 14, R = 16 when d² = 60, which is
just the A = 2 case doubled.

Consider A = 5, which yields B = 65, R = 75 when d² = 1400.

Consider A = 6, which yields B = 21, R = 24 when d² = 135, which is
just the A = 2 case tripled.

Consider A = 7, which yields B = 91, R = 105 when d² = 2744.

The smallest possible radius is 8 megameters when h = 0.

To eliminate the possibility of a smaller radius when h > 0, consider
all the possiblities of R = 4 .. 7, A = 1 .. R-3, B = A+1 .. R-2,
C = B+1 .. R-1, and for none of them, √(R²-A²) - √(R²-B²) = √(R²-B²) - √(R²-C²)
so the smallest possible radius is indeed 8 megameters.

Listing some of the possible values,
|A  |B  |C  |R  |
|---|---|---|---|
|2  |7  |8  |8  |
|7  |11 |13 |14 |
|1  |13 |15 |15 |
|2  |9  |12 |16 |
|4  |11 |14 |16 |

|13 |31 |35 |35 |

Also, consider the possibility that the C cross section is between the
A and B cross sections, rather than B being between A and C,
|A  |B  |C  |R  |
|---|---|---|---|
|17 |47 |49 |51 |
|42 |58 |62 |63 |
|17 |53 |67 |68 |
|36 |68 |84 |75 |
