Let d be the spacing between the cross sections.

Let h be the distance from the center of the planet to the center of
cross section C.
```
  h² + C² = R²
  (h+d)² + B² = R²
  (h+2d)² + A² = R²
```

To minimize R, take h = 0.
```
  R² = C²
  R² = B² + d²
  R² = A² + 4d²
  B² = A² + 3d²
```

Consider A = 1, which yields B = 13, R = 15 when d² = 56.

Consider A = 2, which yields B = 7, R = 8 when d² = 15.

Consider A = 3, which yields B = 39, R = 45 when d² = 504.

Consider A = 4, which yields B = 14, R = 16 when d² = 60, which is
just the A = 2 case doubled.

Consider A = 5, which yields B = 65, R = 75 when d² = 1400.

Consider A = 6, which yields B = 21, R = 24 when d² = 135, which is
just the A = 2 case tripled.

Consider A = 7, which yields B = 91, R = 105 when d² = 2744.

The smallest possible radius is 8 megameters.
