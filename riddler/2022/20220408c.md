==========================
If all 3 pick 3, I assume each has a 1/3 chance at getting the 3 points.
If A gets the 3 points, A wins.  If B gets the 3 points, C wins.  If C
gets the 3 points, B wins.  B and C can do better than a 1/3 chance of winning.

If one of them picks more than 3 and one of them picks less than 3, then A
wins, so they don't want to do that.

If they both pick less than 3, then C can't win unless B picks 2, so C
has no reason to pick less than 3.

If they both pick more than 3, then whoever picks the smaller number gets
the points and whoever picks the greater number wins.

So they both pick 10 and each has a 1/2 chance of winning.
