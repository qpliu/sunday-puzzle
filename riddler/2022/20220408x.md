==========================
Consider a corner cube.  All scores must go to another corner, and there
are 7 other corners, so corner cubes score 7.

Consider a cube on an edge.  Along the edge gets 1.  The edge is the
intersection of two cube faces, each of which gives 1 more.  The edge is
also the side of a diagonal plane, giving 1 more, so edge cubes score 4.

Consider a cube in the center of a face, which is also a edge cube in
4 planes.  On the face, it scores 4.  The other 4 planes together add 1 more,
since they all share one to the center of the opposite face and they each
share another with the face, so the centers of a face score 5.

Consider the center cube.  For corner to corner, it scores 4.  For center
of face to center of face, it scores 3.  For edge to edge, it scores 6,
so the center cube scores 13.

### Reconsidering 2d
For a square at (x,y), (x,_) and (_,y) give 2.

If only one of x = 2 or y = 2, which is an edge, there are no more for a total
of 2.

If neither x = 2 nor y = 2, which is a corner, then going to (4-x,4-y)
gives 1 more for a total of 3.

If both x = 2 and y = 2, which is the center, going to
(x+1,y-1) and (x+1,y+1) gives 2 more for a total of 4.

### Reconsidering 3d
For a cube at (x,y,z), (x,y,_), (x,_,z), and (_,y,z) give 3.

If none of x, y, or z is 2, which is a corner, then going to
(4-x,4-y,z), (4-x,y,4-z), (x,4-y,4-z), and (4-x,4-y,4-z) give 4 more for
a total of 7.

If one of x, y, or z is 2, which is an edge, then, if x = 2, going
to (x,4-y,4-z) gives 1 more for a total of 4.

If two of x, y, and z are 2, which is the center of a face, if x = 2 and
y = 2, then (x+1,y+1,z), (x+1,y-1,z) give 2 more for a total of 5.

If all three of x, y, and z are 2, which the the center, then
(x+1,y+1,z), (x+1,y-1,z), (x+1,y,z+1), (x+1,y,z-1), (x+1,y+1,z+1),
(x+1,y-1,z+1), (x+1,y+1,z-1), (x+1,y-1,z-1), (x,y+1,z+1), (x,y+1,z-1)
give 10 more for a total of 13.

### Considering 4d
For a hypercube at (w,x,y,z), (w,x,y,_), (w,x,_,z), (w,_,y,z), and (_,x,y,z)
give 4.
