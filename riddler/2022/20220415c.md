A number that can be written as ABCABC in base 10 has a factor of 1001, which
has factors 7, 11, and 13.

So ABCABC-1 must be divisible by 6, 10, and 12, which means it must be
divisible by 60, which means C = 1 and B is even.

AB1AB1 is also divisible by AB1, so AB1 cannot have any factors of 7, 11, or
13.

If AB1 is prime, then AB1AB0 must be divisible by AB0, which means AB1000
must be divisible by AB0, or AB100 is divisible by AB.  Let m = AB,
1000m + 100 = km, or (k-1000)m = 100, which works if k = 1010 and m = 10, which
satisfies B being even, making ABC = 101, which is prime.  m = 20 doesn't
work because 201 isn't prime.  m = 25 doesn't work because B would be odd.
m = 50 doesn't work because 501 isn't prime.

The factors of 101101 are 7, 11, 13, and 101, and 101100 is a multiple of
6, 10, 12, and 100.
