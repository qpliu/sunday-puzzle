==========================
I assume that all real speeds, including irrationals, are included.

The Flash will win 6/11 of the time on average.

I expect the average margin of victory to be negative, since the slower
speeds will dominate the average.

Doing the integral for the Flash's average time,
1/(h-l) âˆ«<sub>l</sub><sup>h</sup> 100/s ds = 100 ln(h/l)/(h-l)

Plugging in h = 16 and l = 5 gives approximately 10.574, for an
average margin of victory of approximately -0.574 seconds, which,
as expected, is negative.

If I only calculate the average over the Flash's victoris, then
plugging in h = 16 and l = 10 gives approximately 7.833 for an
average margin of victory of approximately 2.167 seconds.
