2022-04-29 Riddler Classic
==========================
I think it should have been the Phoenix Ones playing the Brooklyn Naughts,
but that wouldn't happen before the finals.

I use [code](20220429c.hs) that adds up the chances of every possible
score differential at each possession as a sum of factors of 50%, 50%-x,
and 50%+x.  Then, I can plug in values of x to get the chance of a tie
or each team's victory.

If x = 50, New York has 0 chance of winning.  If the score
is tied at the start of New York's possession, there is a 75% chance of a tie
and 25% chance of a Brooklyn lead after both teams have had a possession.
If Brooklyn leads at the start of New York's possession, there is a 50% chance
of a tie and 50% chance of a Brooklyn lead after both teams have had a
possession.  So, if the chance of a tie is p (and 1-p chance of a Brooklyn
lead), the chance of the tie after each team has a possession is 3p/4+(1-p)/2
= 1/2+p/4.  After both teams have 100 possessions, the chance of a tie is
1071292029505993517027974728227441735014801995855195223534251/1606938044258990275541962092341162602522202993782792835301376, or approximately 0.666667.  The
result from the code agrees with this.

If x = 0, then the chance that a team scores n times (for 2n points) is
(<sup>100</sup><sub>n</sub>)/2<sup>100</sup>, so the chance of a tie is
∑((<sup>100</sup><sub>n</sub>)/2<sup>100</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = 11318564332012910145675522134685520484313073709426667105165/200867255532373784442745261542645325315275374222849104412672, or approximately 0.056348479.  The result from the
code agrees with this.

The agreement with the results for the two extremes gives me confidence in
the code.

Then, doing a semi-manual search, for a 50% chance of a tie, x is somewhere
between 24.9999999999999742 and 24.9999999999999743, and the chance of a
New York win is approximately 25%, and Brooklyn's chance of winning is
approximately 75%.

In conclusion, x is very close to, but slightly less than, 25, and when there
is no tie, New York has approximately 25% chance of winning, and Brooklyn has
approximately 75% chance of winning.

I suspect x approaches 25 as the number of possessions increases and New York's
chance of winning approaches 1/4 and Brooklyn's chance of winning approaches
3/4.

Additional thoughts
-------------------
Consider a large number of possessions.  After a large number of possessions,
the probability distribution of the score differential should reach a
steady-state when x > 0.  Incidentally, if x = -50, then the first team to
score will win, which would be 1/2 + 1/8 + 1/32 + ... = 2/3 for New York,
and 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + ... = 1/3 for Brooklyn.

Let P(n) be the probability distribution of the score differential at the
start of a New York possession, and Q(n) be the probability distribution
of the score differential at the start of a Brooklyn possession.  Let
p = 1/2 + x/100.
```
   Q(0) = P(0)/2 + pP(-1)
   Q(1) = P(0)/2 + pP(1)
   Q(n) = (1-p)P(n-1) + pP(n) when n > 1
   Q(n) = pP(n-1) + (1-p)P(n) when n < 0

   P(0) = Q(0)/2 + pQ(1)
   P(-1) = Q(0)/2 + pQ(-1)
   P(n) = (1-p)Q(n+1) + pQ(n) when n < -1
   P(n) = pQ(n+1) + (1-p)Q(n) when n > 0
```
Substituting,
```
   P(0) = (P(0)/2+pP(-1))/2 + p(P(0)/2 + pP(1))
   P(-1) = (P(0)/2+pP(-1))/2 + p(pP(-2) + (1-p)P(-1))
   P(n) = (1-p)(pP(n) + (1-p)P(n+1)) + p(pP(n-1) + (1-p)P(n)) when n < -1
   P(1) = p((1-p)P(1) + pP(2)) + (1-p)(P(0)/2 + pP(1))
   P(n) = p((1-p)P(n) + pP(n+1)) + (1-p)((1-p)P(n-1) + pP(n)) when n > 1
```
Based on the numerical solution above, I expect that when P(0) = 1/2,
p = 3/4, and P(-1) = 3P(1),
```
   (3/4 - p/2)P(0) = pP(-1)/2 + p²P(1)
```
which would make P(-1) = 9/32 and P(1) = 3/32, but that's all assuming
the x=25 ny=25% brooklyn=75% solution.

I note that the equations for P(n) for n < -1 and for P(n) for n > 1 are
the same when considering moving n away from zero versus moving n towards
zero.  I assume that the solutions are Gaussian distributions, where the
magnitudes are proportionate to P(1) and P(-1), and the variance is some
function of p.  Without doing a whole bunch of work, that would mean
P(2) = K(p)P(1) and P(-2) = K(p)P(-1), where K(p) is some function of p.

```
  P(-1) = P(0)/4 + pP(-1)/2 + p²K(p)P(-1) + p(1-p)P(-1)
  P(1) = p(1-p)P(1) + p²K(p)P(1) + (1-p)P(0)/2 + p(1-p)P(1)

  (1 - p/2    - p²K(p) - p(1-p)) P(-1) = P(0)/4
  (1 - p(1-p) - p²K(p) - p(1-p)) P(1) =  (1-p)P(0)/2
```
If p = 1/2, then P(-1) = P(1), but p > 1/2, which makes P(-1) > P(1) since
the numerator for P(-1) is greater than the numerator for P(1) (since
1/2 > 1-p), and the denominator for P(-1) is less than the denominator
for P(1) (since -1/2 < -(1-p)).

I note that when p approaches 0, (x = -50), P(-1) = P(1)/2, which agrees with
the previous result that New York wins 2/3 of the time in this case.
Of course, when p = 0, I'd expect P(0) = P(-1) = P(1) = 0, since the first
team to score would continue to score, pushing the distribution to two peaks
at plus and minus infinity.

I don't have any good insight on how to calculate K(p) or p given P(0), which
is 1/2 for this problem.

Further thoughts
----------------
Considering the probability distribution for n > 1,
```
  P(n) = p((1-p)P(n) + pP(n+1)) + (1-p)((1-p)P(n-1) + pP(n)) when n > 1
  P(n) = 2p(1-p)P(n) + p²P(n+1) + (1-p)²P(n-1)
  (1-2p+2p²) P(n) = p²P(n+1) + (1-p)²P(n-1)
```
which is also P(-n) for n < -1.  We also have ∑P(n) = 1.

Let a = p²/(1-2p+2p²), b = (1-p)²/(1-2p+2p²),
```
  P(n) = aP(n+1) + bP(n-1)
       = a²P(n+2) + abP(n) + bP(n-1)
       = a³P(n+3) + a²bP(n+1) + abP(n) + bP(n-1)
       = a³P(n+3) + a³bP(n+2) + (ab+a²b²)P(n) + bP(n-1)
       = a³P(n+3) + a³bP(n+2) + (ab+a²b²)P(n) + bP(n-1)
       = a⁴P(n+4) + 2a³bP(n+2) + (ab+a²b²)P(n) + bP(n-1)
       ...
```
So all terms that get back to P(n) have an equal number of factors of a and b.
But the coefficient depends on the number of ways, starting with a, the
factors are added.  So ab has a coefficient of 1.  (ab)² can be aabb also
has a coefficient of 1.  (ab)³ can be aaabbb or aababb, having a coefficient
of 2.  (ab)⁴ can be aaaabbbb, aaababbb, aaabbabb, aabaabbb, aabababb, having a
coefficent of 5.  (ab)⁵ has a coefficient of 14.  So the
coefficients are Catalan numbers.
```
  P(2) = bP(1)/(1-∑C(n-1)(ab)ⁿ)
  P(-2) = bP(-1)/(1-∑C(n-1)(ab)ⁿ)
```
That means
```
  K(p) = b/(1-∑C(n)(ab)ⁿ⁺¹), where
  
  a = p²/(1-2p+2p²)
  b = (1-p)²/(1-2p+2p²)

  P(0) = (P(0)/2+pP(-1))/2 + p(P(0)/2 + pP(1))
  P(-1) = (P(0)/2+pP(-1))/2 + p(pK(p)P(-1) + (1-p)P(-1))
  P(1) = p((1-p)P(1) + pK(p)P(1)) + (1-p)(P(0)/2 + pP(1))
```
which is 3 equations with 4 unknowns.  If p (which the scorekeeper knows) is
known, it's 3 linear equations with 3 unknowns.  If P(0) is known to be 1/2,
then it's 3 equations with 3 unknowns.  In principle, this could be solved.

What we want to know is P(-1)/P(1), which, based on the numerical solution,
I think is 3.
```
  P(-1) = P(0)/(4(1-p/2 - p²K(p) - p(1-p)))
  P(1) = (1-p)P(0)/(2(1-2p(1-p)-p²K(p)))
  P(-1)/P(1) = (1-2p(1-p)-p²K(p))/(2(1-p)(1-p/2 - p²K(p) - p(1-p)))
```

If p = 3/4, then a = 9/10, b = 1/10, ab = 9/100, and K is close to 1/9.
Plugging in those values gives P(-1)/P(1) = 3.

Then there's the problem of figuring out that p = 3/4 given P(0) = 1/2.
Giving up since I don't have any insight on how to do that.

Further thoughts
----------------
Reading a little more about Catalan numbers,
```
  K(p) = b/(1-∑C(n)(ab)ⁿ⁺¹)

  ∑C(n)(ab)ⁿ⁺¹ = (1-sqrt(1-4ab))/2

  K(p) = 2b/(1+sqrt(1-4ab))
```
So if p = 3/4, and b = 1/10 and ab = 9/100, then K = 1/9 exactly,
and P(-1)/P(1) = 3 exactly.

```
  K(p) = 2(1-p)² / (1-2p+2p²+sqrt(1-4p+4p²))

  P(-1) = (P(0)/2+pP(-1))/2 + p(pK(p)P(-1) + (1-p)P(-1))
        = P(0)/(4 - 2p - 4p²K - 4p(1-p))
  P(1) = p((1-p)P(1) + pK(p)P(1)) + (1-p)(P(0)/2 + pP(1))
       = (1-p)P(0)/(2 - 4p(1-p) - 2p²K)

  P(-1) + P(-2) + P(-3) + ...
       = P(-1) (1 + K + K² + ...)
       = P(-1) / (1 - K)
  P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + ... = P(1) / (1 - K)

  P(0) + (P(1) + P(-1))/(1 - K) = 1
```
This gives an equation for p in terms of P(0), which could determine what
p is when P(0) = 1/2.  More tractably, it gives P(0) as a function of p,
which could be used to verify that P(0) = 1/2 when p = 3/4.
```
  P(0) = 1 / (1 + 1/((1-K)(4-2p-4p²K - 4p(1-p))) + (1-p)/((1-K)(2 - 4p(1-p) - 2p²K)))
```
Tabulating some values
|p   |P(0)|
|----|----|
|1/2 |0   |
|5/8 |1/3 |
|3/4 |1/2 |
|7/8 |3/5 |
|1   |2/3 |

shows that P(0) is indeed 1/2 when p = 3/4, so x = 25 when there is a 50%
chance of a tie after infinite possessions and Brooklyn wins 37.5% of the
time and New York wins 12.5% of the time.
