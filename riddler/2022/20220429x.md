==========================
The relevant denominators are those for which the only prime factors are
2 and 5.  Summing all of them gives,
∑<sub>i</sub>∑<sub>j</sub>1/(2<sup>i</sup>5<sup>j</sup>), which can be factored
into (∑1/2<sup>i</sup>)(∑1/5<sup>i</sup>).

Since ∑1/n<sup>i</sup> = n/(n-1), the sum is 10/4 = 5/2.
