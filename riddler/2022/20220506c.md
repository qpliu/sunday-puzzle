==========================
Assuming numbers with leading zeroes do not qualify for n-digit primes,
there are 21 two-digit primes, 143 three-digit primes, 1061 four-digit
primes, 8363 five-digit primes, 68906 six-digit primes.

I'll use [code](20220506c.hs) that makes a graph of the primes, which gives
a set of primes one step away from each prime.  Then, for each prime, if
I have a set of primes n steps away, I can get a set of primes n+1 steps
away from the graph, filtering out any that are already n or fewer steps
away, resulting in the final set of primes n+1 steps away.  When that
set is empty, then the longest prime ladder for that prime has n steps,
or n+1 numbers.

My algorithm gets super slow for five-digit primes, so it probably needs
an algorithm that works from both ends of the ladder and finding where they
meet, but that would be O(nÂ²) in the number of ladder starts and ends,
rather then O(n) in the number of ladder starts.

For two-digit primes, a longest optimal prime ladder is
97,17,11,71
with 4 numbers.

For three-digit primes, a longest optimal prime ladder is
761,461,401,409,449,349,389
with 7 numbers.

For four-digit primes, a longest optimal prime ladder is
9199,6199,6197,5197,5147,5347,2347,2341,2441
with 9 numbers.

For five-digit primes, a longest optimal prime ladder is
99721,99761,39761,39161,39181,79181,79151,79159,79259,78259,88259
with 11 numbers.

Six-digit primes takes way too long with my one-end algorithm, so I'll
give up on that for now.
