==========================
Assuming numbers with leading zeroes do not qualify for n-digit primes,
there are 21 two-digit primes, 143 three-digit primes, 1061 four-digit
primes, 8363 five-digit primes, 68906 six-digit primes.

I'll use [code](20220506c.hs) that makes a graph of the primes, which gives
a set of primes one step away from each prime.  Then, for each prime, if
I have a set of primes n steps away, I can get a set of primes n+1 steps
away from the graph, filtering out any that are already n or fewer steps
away, resulting in the final set of primes n+1 steps away.  When that
set is empty, then the longest prime ladder for that prime has n steps,
or n+1 numbers.

My algorithm gets super slow for five-digit primes, so it probably needs
an algorithm that works from both ends of the ladder and finding where they
meet, but that would be O(nÂ²) in the number of ladder starts and ends,
rather then O(n) in the number of ladder starts.

For two-digit primes, a longest optimal prime ladder is
97,17,11,71
with 4 numbers.

For three-digit primes, a longest optimal prime ladder is
761,461,401,409,449,349,389
with 7 numbers.

For four-digit primes, a longest optimal prime ladder is
9199,6199,6197,5197,5147,5347,2347,2341,2441
with 9 numbers.

For five-digit primes, a longest optimal prime ladder is
99721,99761,39761,39161,39181,79181,79151,79159,79259,78259,88259
with 11 numbers.

Six-digit primes takes way too long with my one-end algorithm, so I'll
give up on that for now.

Additional thoughts
-------------------
Another consideration for a two-end algorithm is that there may not be
a ladder between two primes.  For this to be the case, the graph would be
composed of multiple connected subgraphs, and each subgraph can be
considered separately, which would help make the search faster.

The graphs of two-digit primes, three-digit primes, four-digit primes,
five-digit primes are all connected.

Checking the graph of six-digit primes takes a long time and 
68900 of the 68906 primes are connected.  The other 6
(294001,505447,584141,604171,929573,971767) are not connected at all.

There are 29 6-digit primes
(134129,283961,321187,373229,440497,444623,448519,472261,492839,504991,509557,553919,575009,578923,591937,605707,623107,629339,649559,687847,714037,744019,756011,791081,806671,893567,976559,991607,995833)
that are connected to only one other prime.  That seems like a good place
to start the search.  It's certainly better than searching all pairs, though
we could eliminate half of those, say, by only considering pairs for which
the bottom of the ladder is greater than the top of the ladder, since the
same ladder upside-down has the same length.

Considering 2-digit primes, 97 is connected to 4 other primes.  All other
primes are connected to more than 4.  It make sense that 97 would be part of
a longest ladder.  53 and 71 are connected to 6 other primes.  The most
connected primes are connected to 8 other primes.

Considering 3-digit primes, 929 is connected to 3 other primes.  Four
other primes (389,659,743,953) are connected to 4 other primes.  All other
primes are connected to more than 4.  I'll have to figure out the longest
ladder starting with 929, but 389 is at the end of a longest ladder.
761, at the other end of a longest ladder, is connected to 5 other primes.
The most connected primes are connected to 11 other primes.

Considering 4-digit primes, 6983 is connected to only 1 other prime, and
4 others (4409,5077,6841,9199) are connected to 2 other primes.  I'll have
to figure out the longest ladder starting with 6983, but 9199 is at the
end of a longest ladder.  2441, at the other end of a longest ladder, is
connected to 7 other primes.  The most connected primes are connected to
14 other primes.

Considering 5-digit primes, 5 primes (46769,97039,97919,98519,99721) are
connected to only one other prime and 99721 is at the end of a longest
ladder.  88259, at the other end of a longest ladder, is connected to 4
other primes.  The most connected primes are connected to 16 other primes. 

It makes sense to consider ladders that start with primes that are
connected to few other primes.  But their longest ladders probably won't
end the least connected, but probably not with the most connected either.

Using a two-ended search, restricting the ends of the ladders to numbers
with a maximum number of connections,
|digits|max connections|longest ladder|
|------|---------------|--------------|
|2     |5              |4: 97,7,19,89 |
|3     |5              |7: 389,349,149,109,101,701,761 |

For the 6-digit ladders, I searched ladders that started and ended with primes
that had up to 3 connections, and it was still very slow.  It may be that
a longer ladder might start or end with a prime with 4 or more connections.
