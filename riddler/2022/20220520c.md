==========================
There are 3 axes of rotation.  Let one of them be the line between us and
the black hole, which means rotations about that axis are irrelevant.

Around each of the other 2 axes, the rotation could be from 0° to 360°.

Let a be the rotation about one of the axes and b be the rotation about
the other axis.  The rotation from perpendicular, c(a,b), is some function
of a and b to be calculated.

The probability of being near perpendicular is the integral over the two
axes from 0° to 360° for which c(a,b) is less than 10°, between 170° and
190°, or more than 350°.

On the plane,
```
  z = x tan a + y tan b
```
To be on the edge of a circle, y = √(1-x²).
Maximize z with respect to x.
```
  z = x tan a + √(1-x²) tan b

  dz/dx = tan a + 1/2 1/√(1-x²) (-2x) tan b
        = tan a - x/√(1-x²) tan b
	= 0

  x/√(1-x²) = tan a / tan b
```
Let k = tan a / tan b.
```
  x = k √(1-x²)

  x² = k²(1-x²)
  x² = k²/(1+k²)
  y² = 1/(1+k²)

  z = (k tan a)/√(1+k²) + tan b/√(1+k²)
    = √(tan²a + tan²b)
```
Then we have c, where tan c = z
```
  tan c = √(tan²a + tan²b)
```
By symmetry, consider only 0° to 90°, and nearly perpendicular means
0° to 10°.  Let 𝜙 = 10° = 𝜋/18.
```
  ∫2da/𝜋 ∫2db/𝜋 H(tan²𝜙 - tan²a - tan²b)
```
The limits of the integrals can be reduced from 0 to 𝜋/2 to 0 to 𝜙.

Doing the inner integral yields
```
    ∫4da/𝜋² arctan√(tan²𝜙 - tan²a)
```
which, according to WolframAlpha, is approximately 0.009745524, about 0.97%.

What I got wrong
----------------
The answer should have been 1 - cos𝜙.  I don't know why my approach doesn't
agree.
