==========================
If the distance is x, then, crawling radially, the new distance is x+1.
Crawling tangentially, the new distance is √(x²+1).

There are 8 possible paths, rrrr, rrrt, rrtr, rrtt, rtrr, rtrt, rttr, rttt,
each equally likely.

The distances from the center are
* rrrr = 4
* rrrt = √10
* rrtr = √5 + 1
* rrtt = √6
* rtrr = √2 + 2
* rtrt = √((√2 + 1)² + 1) = √(4 + 2√2)
* rttr = √3 + 1
* rttt = √4 = 2

The average distance from the center is
(10 + √10 + √5 + √6 + √2 + √(4 + 2√2) + √3)/8, or approximately 2.95.
