==========================
I'll assume the king is a point particle, or at least has zero size in the
non-vertical directions.

Let my position be (0,t).  Let the king's position be (Rsin𝜃,t+Rcos𝜃) where
R = 10m, and 𝜃 is initially zero.  When 𝜃 = 𝜋/4, the king is able to avoid
being cornered, and I will have moved t.  The minimum side length of the
courtyard would be 2R + t(𝜋/4)√2.

At all times, we move at the same speed,
```
  (Rcos𝜃 d𝜃/dt)² + (1 - Rsin𝜃 d𝜃/dt)² = 1
  (R d𝜃/dt)² + 1 - 2Rsin𝜃 d𝜃/dt = 1

  R/2 d𝜃/dt = sin𝜃

  t = R/2 (ln|cosec𝜃 - cot𝜃| - ln|cosec0 - cot0|)
```
This seems to say that if I move straight at the king, the king can only
move straight away from me, making the minimum size of the courtyard infinite.

Let the king's position be (t,R).  Then, the square of the distance between
us would be
```
  t² + (R - t)² = 2t² - 2Rt + R²
```
which, for small t, is less than R², so if I move straight at the king, it's
not possible for the king to sidestep by moving perpendicularly.

Let the king's position be (tsin𝛼,R+tcos𝛼) where 𝛼 is a constant.  The
square of the distance between us would be
```
  (tsin𝛼)² + (R+t(-1+cos𝛼))² =
  t²sin²𝛼 + R² + 2Rt(-1+cos𝛼) + t²(1 - 2cos𝛼 + cos²𝛼) =
  2t²(1-cos𝛼) - 2Rt(1-cos𝛼) + R²
```
which is less than R² when t is small unless 𝛼 = 0, so it's not possible
for the king to sidestep if I move straight towards the king.

If the king has a radius r and maintains a distance of at least r+R,
the calculations don't change.

So I don't see how there can be a minimum size of the courtyard, unless I
know that the king starts some finite distance more than 10m away from me.

Suppose the king is initially R+r away, then, if the king initially moves
perpendicularly, the square of the distance between us is
```
  t² + (R + r - t)² =
  2t² - 2(R+r)t + (R+r)² =
  2t² - 2(R+r)t + r² + 2rR + R²
```
solve for t = t₀ when this distance drops to R,
```
   2t₀² - 2(R+r)t₀ + r² + 2rR = 0
```
Then let sin𝜃₀ = t₀/R, and then
```
  t = R/2 (ln(cosec(𝜋/4) - cot(𝜋/4)) - ln(cosec𝜃₀ - cot𝜃₀))
    = R/2 ln((√2-1)/(cosec𝜃₀ - cot𝜃₀))
    = R/2 ln((√2-1) t₀/(R - √(R²-t₀²)))
```
so the minimum side length is
```
  2R + R/√2 ln((√2-1) (t₀/(R - √(R²-t₀²))))
```
When r is small, t₀ is approximately r, and the minimum side length is
approximately
```
  2R + R/√2 ln((√2-1) r/(R - √(R²-r²)))
```
which is approximately
```
  2R + R/√2 ln((√2-1) 2R/r)
```
And if that is the side length and if I head directly at a corner, then
the area in which the king cannot escape being spotted is approximately
2R𝜃₀r/2, which is approximately r², so my chance of spotting the king is
approximately
```
  k = r²/((2R + R/√2 ln((√2-1) 2R/r))² - 𝜋R²)
```
which is approximately
```
  k = (r/(2R ln((√2-1) 2R/r)))²
```
when r is small.
```
  √k = r/2R 1/ln((√2-1) 2R/r)

  (√2-1) 2R/r = exp(r/2R 1/√k)

  r/2R = √k W₀((√2-1)/√k)
```
where W₀ is the Lambert function.  And for small k, we can approximate
```
  r/2R = √k ln((√2-1)/√k)
```
and the side length of the courtyard is approximately
```
  2R + R/√2 ln((√2-1)/√k 1/ln((√2-1)/√k))
```
where R = 10m and k is my chance of spotting the king.
