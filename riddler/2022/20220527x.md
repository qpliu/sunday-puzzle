==========================
I assume that an unprotected rook could be captured, which is to be avoided.

If the first three moves are b1-b2 a2-a3 a1-a2, the king and both rooks
remain protected and the enemy king's domain shrinks.  Continuing in the
same vein, the enemy king runs out of room and is checkmated in the top
row, but not in the two leftmost columns.

Could also do a similar three moves to the right instead of three moves up
to shrink the enemy domain at any point.
