==========================
The probability that no paths intersect P(N) = (1-I(N))P(N-1) where
I(N) is the probability that the Nth path intersects one of the
other N-1 paths, given that the other paths do not intersect.

Let the oasis be oriented from west to east, and let traveler 1 start
from the western-most location and traveler N start from the eastern-most
location, with travelers 2 through N-1 in between.

P(1) = 1.  Let traveler 1's direction be northerly.

If traveler 2's direction is southerly, then the chance of intersection is 0.
If traveler 2's direction is northerly, then the chance of intersection is 1/2.
That makes I(2) = 1/4, P(2) = 3/4.

In general, if there are L travelers starting from further west going northerly
and M travelers starting from further west going southerly, and none of them
intersect, the L+M+1th traveler, when going northerly, will have
1-2<sup>-L</sup> chance of intersecting, and when going southerly,
will have a 1-2<sup>-M</sup> chance of intersecting.
And the chance of having L (out of N-1) travelers
headed northerly is (<sup>N-1</sup><sub>L</sub>)/2<sup>N-1</sup>, making

I(N) = ∑<sub>L=0</sub><sup>N-1</sup>(<sup>N-1</sup><sub>L</sub>)/2<sup>N-1</sup>(1/2 (1-1/2<sup>L</sup>) + 1/2(1-1/2<sup>N-1-L</sup>))

which makes

P(N) = ∏<sub>M=1</sub><sup>N</sup>(1-I(M))
