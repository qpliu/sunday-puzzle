==========================
We can add 4 to all the numbers made by the first 3, making every number
up to 13 makeable.  We can quadruple all the numbers made by the first
3 by making every multiple of 4 up to 36 makeable.

* 14 = 2×3×4
* 15 = (4+1)×3
* 17 = (4+1)×3+2
* 18 = (3+1)×4+2
* 19 = (4+2)×3+1
* 21 = (3+2)×4+1
* 22 = 11×2 or (21+1 or 20+2 or 19+3 or 18+4 or 17+5 or ... 11+11)
** 11 cannot be made from 1, 3, 4
** 21 cannot be made from 2, 3, 4
** 20 cannot be made from 1, 3, 4
** 19 cannot be made from 1, 2, 4 (+3) or 3, 4 (+(1+2))
** 18 cannot be made from 1, 2, 3 (+4) or 2, 4 (+(1+3))
** 17 cannot be made from 2, 3 (+(1+4)) or 1, 4 (+(2+3))
** 16 cannot be made from 1, 4 (+(2×3)) or 1, 3 (+(2+4))
** 15 cannot be made from 4 (+(1+(2×3))) or 2 (+(4+3))
** 14 cannot be made from 4 (+(2×(1+3))) or 1, 3 (+2×4)
** 13 cannot be made from 4 (+(3×(1+2))) or 3 (+(1+2×4))
** 12 cannot be made from 3 (+(2×(1+4))) or 1 (+(4+2×3))
** 11 cannot be made twice from 1, 2, 3, 4

So FUN4 = 22.

Extra credit
------------
Using [code](20220603x.hs) that is pretty slow, FUN5 = 58.
