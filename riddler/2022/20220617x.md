==========================
I assume that it's not valid to change leading zeroes.  If it were, then
10<sup>n</sup>p mod 11 where p is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, would give
9 different values, since 10 and 11 are relatively prime, and 10<sup>n+1</sup>q
mod 11 will not be the same 9 values, so any number can be made into a
multiple of 11 by changing some leading zero.

Every number that is not in the ranges 110n-10 to 110n-1 is a multiple of 11
or can be made into a multiple of 11 by changing the ones digit.

Nine of the numbers in ranges 110n-10  to 110n-1 can be made into a multiple
of 11 by changing the tens digit.

Any number x that is not a multiple of 11 can be made into a multiple of 11
by adding a number y where y mod 11 = 11 - x mod 11.

Considering 100-109, only 109 cannot be made a multiple of 11 by changing
the tens digit, and 209 is a multiple of 11.

Considering 210-219, only 218 cannot be made a multiple of 11 by changing
the tens digit, and 418 is a multiple of 11.

Considering 320-329, only 327 cannot be made a multiple of 11 by changing
the tens digit, and 627 is a multiple of 11.

Considering 430-439, only 436 cannot be made a multiple of 11 by changing
the tens digit, and 836 is a multiple of 11.

Considering 540-549, only 545 cannot be made a multiple of 11 by changing
the tens digit, and it also cannot be made into a multiple of 11 by changing
the hundreds digit.  Although, 6545 is a multiple of 11.

So the answer is 545.

Another approach
----------------
Consider every number x in a range 100n-10 to 110n-1.  Tabulating the
ones digit and x mod 11,
|ones digit of x|x mod 11|
|---------------|--------|
|0              |1       |
|1              |2       |
|2              |3       |
|3              |4       |
|4              |5       |
|5              |6       |
|6              |7       |
|7              |8       |
|8              |9       |
|9              |10      |

Tabulating the tens digit and x mod 11 such that changing the tens digit cannot
be made into a multiple of 11,
|tens digit|x mod 11|
|----------|--------|
|0         |10      |
|1         |9       |
|2         |8       |
|3         |7       |
|4         |6       |
|5         |5       |
|6         |4       |
|7         |3       |
|8         |2       |
|9         |1       |

Tabulating the hundreds digit and x mod 11 such that changing the hundreds
digit cannot be made into a multiple of 11,
|hundreds digit|x mod 11|
|--------------|--------|
|0             |1       |
|1             |2       |
|2             |3       |
|3             |4       |
|4             |5       |
|5             |6       |
|6             |7       |
|7             |8       |
|8             |9       |
|9             |10      |

Tabulating the thousands digit and x mod 11 such that changing the thousands
digit cannot be made into a multiple of 11,
|thousands digit|x mod 11|
|---------------|--------|
|0              |10      |
|1              |9       |
|2              |8       |
|3              |7       |
|4              |6       |
|5              |5       |
|6              |4       |
|7              |3       |
|8              |2       |
|9              |1       |

So the numbers we are looking for must have digits that alternate between
x and 9-x.

So if the number ends in 0, its digits must alternate between 9 and 0 and
the number mod 11 must be 1, and the smallest such number is 909090909090.

Tabulating,
|ones digit|smallest number that can't become multiple of 11|
|----------|------------------------------------------------|
|0         |909090909090|
|1         |1818181|
|2         |27272|
|3         |636363636363|
|4         |545454545454|
|5         |545|
|6         |636363636|
|7         |272727272727|
|8         |181818181818|
|9         |90909090909|

Other numbers with 12 or fewer digits that can't be made into a multiple of 11,
* 454545454545
* 818181818181
* 727272727272
* 363636363636

Generating all numbers with the property
----------------------------------------
Using code,
```haskell
generate n = (if n `mod` 11 == (n `mod` 10) + 1 then (n:) else id) (generate (10*n + 9 - n `mod` 10))
```
and looking at its output, it looks like all numbers with the property
have 12+22n digits or 12+22n+f(d) digits, where d is the ones digit and f is
|d  |f  |
|---|---|
|0  |1 (if counting the leading zero)|
|1  |-5 |
|2  |-7 |
|3  |3  |
|4  |9  |
|5  |-9 |
|6  |-3 |
|7  |7  |
|8  |5  |
|9  |-1 |

Code that generates every number that cannot be made into a multiple of 11
by changing a digit in ascending order:
```haskell
rx20220617 :: [Integer]
rx20220617=s 45 3:s 72 5:s 81 7:s 36 9:s 9 12:s 18 12:s 27 12:s 36 12:s 45 12:s 54 12:s 63 12:s 72 12:s 81 12:s 90 12:s 63 15:s 18 17:s 27 19:s 54 21:map(\n->n*10^22+n`mod`100*101010101010101010101)rx20220617 where s n d=101010101010101010101*n`mod`10^d
```
which is much faster then the brute-force code:
```haskell
bruteforce20220617 :: [Integer]
bruteforce20220617=filter(null.filter((==0).(`mod`11)).let r d n=if n`div`d==0 then[]else[(n`div`(d*10))*d*10+i*d+n`mod`d|i<-[0..9]]++r(d*10)n in r 1)[1..]
```
