==========================
I assume that it's not valid to change leading zeroes.  If it were, then
10<sup>n</sup>p mod 11 where p is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, would give
9 different values, since 10 and 11 are relatively prime, and 10<sup>n+1</sup>q
mod 11 will not be the same 9 values, so any number can be made into a
multiple of 11 by changing some leading zero.

Every number that is not in the ranges 110n-10 to 110n-1 is a multiple of 11
or can be made into a multiple of 11 by changing the ones digit.

Nine of the numbers in ranges 110n-10  to 110n-1 can be made into a multiple
of 11 by changing the tens digit.

Any number x that is not a multiple of 11 can be made into a multiple of 11
by adding a number y where y mod 11 = 11 - x mod 11.

Considering 100-109, only 109 cannot be made a multiple of 11 by changing
the tens digit, and 209 is a multiple of 11.

Considering 210-219, only 218 cannot be made a multiple of 11 by changing
the tens digit, and 418 is a multiple of 11.

Considering 320-329, only 327 cannot be made a multiple of 11 by changing
the tens digit, and 627 is a multiple of 11.

Considering 430-439, only 436 cannot be made a multiple of 11 by changing
the tens digit, and 836 is a multiple of 11.

Considering 540-549, only 545 cannot be made a multiple of 11 by changing
the tens digit, and it also cannot be made into a multiple of 11 by changing
the hundreds digit.  Although, 6545 is a multiple of 11.

So the answer is 545.
