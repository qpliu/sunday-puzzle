==========================
A brute-force calculation is feasible for up to 8 camels.

I used [code](20220624c.hs) that can handle more camels by
doing this calculation for 10 camels:
```
  P({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}) =
      P({2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 2P({1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 3P({1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 3P({1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 4P({1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 5P({1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 6P({1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10})/10
    + 7P({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10})/10
    + 9P({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10})/10
    + 10P({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9})/10
```
where
```
  P({2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}) =
      2P({3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 2P({2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 3P({2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 4P({2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 5P({2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 6P({2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10})/10
    + 7P({2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10})/10
    + 8P({2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10})/10
    + 9P({2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9})/10

  P({1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}) =
      P({3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10})/10
    + P({1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 2P({1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 3P({1,3,4,6,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 4P({1,3,4,5,7,8,9,10})/10
    + 5P({1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10})/10
    + 6P({1,3,4,5,6,7,9,10})/10
    + 7P({1,3,4,5,6,7,8,10})/10
    + 8P({1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9})/10

  ...

  P({1,2}) = 2P({1})/10 + P({2})/10
  P({1,3}) = P({1})/10 + P({3})/10
  P({1,4}) = P({1})/10 + P({4})/10

  ...

  P({1}) = P({})/10
  P({2}) = P({})/10

  ...

  P({9}) = P({})/10
  P({10}) = P({})/10

  P({}) = 1

It looks like it's (n+1)ⁿ⁻¹/nⁿ, but I don't know how to prove it.

That makes the ten camel probability 11⁹/10¹⁰.

Further thoughts
----------------
Let P(n) be the chance that n goats occupy n floors with none on the roof.

If at least 2 goats prefer floor n, then at least one of them gets the roof.

There's a 1/n chance the the first goat prefers floor n, and the
chance that none of them gets the roof is
```
  ((n-1)/n)ⁿ⁻¹ P(n-1)
```
and there's a (n-1)/n chance the first goat doesn't prefer floor n, in which
case there's a 1/n the chance that the second goat prefers floor n, and the
chance that none of them gets the roof is
```
  ((n-1)/n)ⁿ⁻² P(n-1)
```
and so on, until there's a cumulative ((n-1)/n)ⁿ chance that none of the
goats prefer floor n.  Let Q(n) be the chance that
no more than 1 goat gets the roof when n+1 goats choose between n floors.

Adding it up,
```
  P(n) = (1/n)((n-1)/n)ⁿ⁻¹P(n-1) + (n-1)/n ((1/n)((n-1)/n)ⁿ⁻² P(n-1) + (n-1)/n (...)) + ((n-1)/n)ⁿQ(n-1)
       = (n-1)ⁿ⁻¹/nⁿ P(n-1) + (n-1)ⁿ/nⁿ Q(n-1)
```

Since it should work out that P(n) = (n²-1)ⁿ⁻¹/n²ⁿ⁻² P(n-1), it means
```
  Q(n) = ((n+2)ⁿ - (n+1)ⁿ⁻¹)/(n(n+1)ⁿ⁻¹) P(n)
```
but I don't know how to get that.

Another approach
----------------
There must be at least one goat that prefers the first floor.  There
are nⁿ - (n-1)ⁿ out of nⁿ cases in which that is the case.  Of these
cases, there must be at least one more goat that prefers one of the
first two floors.  And since the order of the goats doesn't matter,
there should be a symmetry between the goats in these cases.
```
  nⁿ - (n-1)ⁿ = nⁿ - ∑ᵢ₌₀ⁿ(ⁿᵢ)(-1)ⁱnⁿ⁻ⁱ
              = (-1)ⁿ⁻ⁱ + ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ⁻ⁱ(ⁿᵢ)(-1)ⁱnⁿ⁻ⁱ
```
When n is odd, the 1 corresponds to all the goats preferring the first
floor and rest is a multiple of n, reflecting the symmetry between the
goats.  When n is even, there are n-1 cases that I don't know how to
interpret, and the rest is a multiple of n, reflecting the symmetry between
the goats.  For n=3, there are 19 out of 27 cases.  For n=4, there are 175
out of 256 cases.

There must be at least two goats that prefer one of the first two floors,
and in each of the nⁿ - (n-1)ⁿ cases, at least one goat prefers the first
floor, so there must be at least one more that prefers one of the first
two floors.  For n=3, there are 16 out of 19 cases.  For n=4, there are
143 out of 175 cases.  I can't figure out how to reason about the
nⁿ - (n-1)ⁿ cases.
