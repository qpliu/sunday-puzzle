==========================
Let $R$ be the radius of the planet.  Let $h$ be 100m.  I assume that there
are no mountains or significant depressions between the towers.

Halfway between the towers, you'd have to be at least $h$ above the ground
to be able to see the bases of the towers, assuming there are no buildings
in the cities obstructing the view of the bases of the towers.

Let $cos\alpha = \frac R{R+h}$.

Let $H$ be how high above the ground you need to be in one tower to be able
to see the base of the other tower.

$$ cos2\alpha = \frac R{R+H} $$

$$ cos2\alpha = 2cos^2\alpha - 1
              = \frac{2R^2}{(R+h)^2} - 1
              = \frac{2R^2-(R+h)^2}{(R+h)^2}
$$

$$ \frac{R+H}R = \frac{R^2+2hR+h^2}{R^2-2hR-h^2} $$

$$ \frac HR = \frac{R^2+2hR+h^2-R^2+2hR+h^2}{R^2-2hR-h^2}
            = \frac{4hR+2h^2}{R^2-2hR-h^2}
$$

If $R \gg h$ and $R \gg H$, $H \approx 4h$, or about 400m.

Further thoughts
----------------
To go Saint-Exup√©ry, if $\alpha\ge\frac\pi4$, then $cos2\alpha\le0$ and the
base of the other tower will be occluded no matter how high you go.
$\alpha=\frac\pi4$ when $R+h=R\sqrt2$, or $R=\frac h{\sqrt2-1}$, which,
when $h$ is 100m, is about 241.42m.  So, if $R$ is less than about 241.42m,
the base of the neighboring tower will always be below the horizon.
