==========================
Connecting California and New York while keeping the USP contiguous means
the entire west coast and northern border states is in the USY.  New York
means all of New England is in the USY.  That makes 20 states that must
be in the USY.

Arizona must be in the USY to keep New Mexico and Colorado connected to
the USY while keeping Wyoming and Utah connected to the USP.  That makes
21 states that must be in the USY.

For Virginia to be in the USY, all Atlantic coast states to its north
must be part of the USY, meaning Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey,
making 25 states in the USY.

There is no way for Virginia to be in the USY while maintaining
contiguity of both the USP and the USY and limiting the USY to 24 states
without redrawing state borders.
