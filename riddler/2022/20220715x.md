==========================
Given any 5 rows (or columns) that can make a square, there are 120
possible arrangements.  Of those 5 rows (or columns), exactly one has
a 1 first and exactly one has a 1 last.  For a corner to contain a 1,
the row that has a 1 first or the row that has a 1 last has to be
either first or last, which turns out to be 84 out of the 120, so the
probability that no corner contains a 1 is 36/120.

Given a first row (or column) and 4 others that can make a square,
there are 4!=24 arrangements of the 4 others.  Of the 4, exactly 
exactly one has the first number of the first row last, and exactly
one has the last number of the first row first.  If they are the same
row, the probability that two corners have the same number is 1/4.  If
they are different rows, the probability is 1/2.

The probability that a square has two corners with the same number is
p/4 + (1-p)/2, where p is the probability that, given a first row, of
the 4 other rows, the one that has the first number of the first row
last has the has the last number of the first number first.

There is always a row that has the first number of the first row
last, and there are 4!=24 possible such rows.  Of those, there are 6
that have the last number of the first row first, so p=1/4, making the
probability that two of the corners have the same number 7/16.
