==========================
First, take a marble from "assorted".  Call its color color-1.  Then,
take the second marble from the bag labeled with color-1.  

If the second marble's color is color-1, then the bag labeled with
color-1 has assorted and it's safe to take any two of the other three
bags.

Otherwise, call the second marble's color color-2, and the remaining
color color-3.

If the bag labeled with color-1 has assorted, then it's safe to take
the bag labeled "assorted" and the bag labeled with color-2, which has
color-3.

If the bag labeled with color-1 does not have assorted, then the bags
labeled with color-2 and color-3 have assorted and color-3.  Since the
bag labeled with color-3 can't have color-3, it must have assorted,
and it's safe to take the bag labeled "assorted" and the bag labeled
with color-2, which has color-3.
