==========================
At the time each of your teammates takes the front, he or she has
exactly enough energy to lead the team up half the remaining climb.
After your seven teammates crack, you have 1/128 of the climb
remaining.  Assuming you make it alone to the top at tempo, you
started with least 129/128 the energy of your teammates.
