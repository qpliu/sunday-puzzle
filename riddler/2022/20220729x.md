==========================
If the ball is under the initial cup, then, after a swap, it is not
under the initial cup.  If the ball is not under the initial cup,
then, after a swap, it has a 50% chance of being under the initial cup
and a 50% chance of not being under the initial cup.

Let $I_n$ be the chance the ball is under the initial cup after $n$
swaps.  After a swap, $I_{n+1} = 1/2 - I_n/2$.  $I_0 = 1$.

After an odd number of swaps $I_n < 1/3$, and after a even number of
swaps, $I_n > 1/3$, and $I_n$ approaches 1/3 as $n$ gets large.

So the strategy would be to choose the initial cup after an even
number of swaps and another cup after an odd number of swaps.
