==========================
To establish a baseline, when betting everything in one shot, the
probability of success is 90/250, or 36%.

I suspect the house 10% makes trying to incrementally win less than enough
to get to 250 to be suboptimal.  Also, trying to win more than enough to
get to 250 is suboptimal.

Let $h = 0.9$ and $G = 250$.

If I have $X$ and bet a fraction $fX$ to try to win $G-(1-f)X$.

The chance of success is

$$ S(X) = \frac{hfX + (G-(1-f)X - hfX)S((1-f)X)}{G-(1-f)X} $$

Since $S(0) = 0$, this gives $S = hX/G$ when $f = 1$.

If $f$ is small,

$$ S(X) = S(X) + \frac{(hX + (1-h)XS(X) - (G-X)XS'(X)}{G - X}f - \frac{S(X)X}{G-X}f + O(f^2) $$

Looking at the order $f$ terms,

$$ S' = \frac{h}{G-X}(1-S) $$

Integrating, with boundary condition $S(0) = 0$,

$$ S = 1 - (1-X/G)^h $$

When $X=100$, $G=250$, $h=0.9$, $S = 1 - (3/5)^{9/10} \approx 0.36855 > 0.36$,
so making many, many, tiny, long-shot bets has a better probability of success
than betting everything in one shot.
