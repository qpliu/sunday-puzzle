==========================
On day $n$, there's a probability $P(x,n)$ that there are $x$ half pills and
$y = 15-3n/2-x/2$ full pills.

For each day, $\sum_x P(x,n) = 1$.

For day 1, $P(0,1) = 1$.

On day 10, $P(3,10) + P(1,10) = 1$, and $P(1,10)$ is the probability of
having taken the full dose.

Given $x$ half pills and $y$ full pills on day $n$, there are up to three
outcomes
* $x-3$ half pills and $y$ full pills
* $x-1$ half pills and $y-1$ full pills
  * take 1 half pill and 1 full pill
  * take 2 half pills and 1 full pill, return half pill
* $x+1$ half pills and $y-2$ full pills

Using [code](20220819c.hs) to enumerate the probabilities of having $x$ half pills on each day

There is a 80529/101920 chance of having one full pill and one half pill, and a 21391/101920
chance of having no full pills and three half pills, so the chance of not having thrown out a half
pill is 80529/101920, or about 79%.
