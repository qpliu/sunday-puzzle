==========================
If $2 = (1+r/100)^t$ and $t = 72/r$, then

$$ r/100 = 2^{r/72}-1 $$

which has roots at $r \approx 7.84687$ and $r = 0$.  The zero root
corresponds to an infinite doubling time.  I can't find an exact
expression for the non-zero root, which has a doubling time of
approximately 9.17563 years.
