==========================
Consider the $i$ th car.  If every car ahead of it is faster, it will
lead a group in the first lane.  Otherwise, it will lead a group in the
second lane if all cars ahead of it and slower than it remain in the first
lane, which happens when all cars ahead of it and slower than it are
ordered by their speed.

The $i$ th car has $1/i$ chance of being the $j$ th slowest of the first
$i$ cars.  There are $j-1$ slower cars ahead of it, which could be ordered
in $(j-1)!$ ways, only one of which results in the $i$ th car leading its
own group.  So, on average, the $i$ th car would add
$\sum_{j=1}^i\frac1{i(j-1)!}$ to the number of groups.

So, for $N$ cars, the average number of groups would be

$$ \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^i \frac1{i(j-1)!} $$

Using [code](20220826c.hs), for the first few values $N$, the average
number of groups are
|$N$|groups|
|---|------|
|1  |1 |
|2  |2 |
|3  |17/6 |
|4  |7/2 |
|5  |97/24 |
|6  |809/180 |
|7  |8203/1680 |
|8  |52643/10080 |
|9  |2004749/362880 |
|10 |23371/4032 |
|11 |241237001/39916800 |
|12 |750837281/119750400 |
|13 |1034502563/159667200 |
|14 |145441299221/21794572800 |
|15 |1792690623613/261534873600 |
|16 |12247489780093/1743565824000 |

|20 |71249295590909413/9357315416064000 |

And brute-force calculations for $N \le 10$ agree.
