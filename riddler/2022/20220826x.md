==========================
If your strategy is to pick up to $M$ cards, you have a $(9/10)^M$ chance
of winning $M$ prizes, for an average of $(9/10)^MM$ prizes won.  To maximize
the average number prizes won, keep picking while

$$ (9/10)^MM > (9/10)^{M-1}(M-1) $$

or $\frac{M-1}M$ < 9/10.  $(9/10)^MM$ is maximized at 3486784401/1000000000
when $M = 9$ and $M = 10$.

Similar reasoning means the strategy is to keep picking while
$\frac{M-1}M < \frac{N-1}N$, and the strategy is to pick up to $N-1$ or $N$
cards, winning an average of $\frac{(N-1)^N}{N^{N-1}}$ prizes a day.

Additional thoughts
-------------------
If the prizes won after $M$ winning picks is $W(M)$ and the chance of winning
is $P(M)$, then if $W(M+1)P(M+1) > W(M)P(M)$ then the strategy should be
to pick $M+1$ over picking $M$.  However, if $W(M+1)P(M+1) < W(M)P(M)$, it's
not so clear, since, if $W(i)$ is very large for some $i > M+1$, it could
make sense to keep picking until after the $i$th card.  But, in these cases,
$W(M) = M$, so it's always the case that $W(M+1)/W(M) < W(M)/W(M-1)$.  It also
must be true that $P(M+1)/P(M) \le 1$.  So the generalization of the strategy
is to keep picking as long as $W(M+1)/W(M) < P(M)/P(M+1)$, and since
$W(M+1)/W(M)$ decreases as $M$ increases, while $P(M)/P(M+1) \ge 1$, there
might be some $M$ that maximizes the average winnings.

Consider an alternate scenario in which playing again means playing with
the remaining $N-1$ cards instead of with $N$ newly dealt cards.  Then,
instead of $P(M+1) = \frac{N-1}NP(M)$, $P(M+1) = \frac{N-M}{N-M+1}P(M)$.
Also, $W(M) = M$ continues to hold, so the strategy would be to continue
picking as long as $(M+1)\frac{N-M}{N-M+1}P(M) < MP(M)$, or
$\frac{M+1}M < \frac{N-M+1}{N-M}$, winning $\frac{M(N-M)}N$, which is
maximized when $M=N/2$ when $N$ is even, or either nearest whole number
when $N$ is odd.  When $N=10$, the strategy would be to pick up to 5 cards,
winning 5/2 prizes a day on average.
