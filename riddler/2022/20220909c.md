==========================
First, consider having 4 circles covering the 4 corners, with radius $r$,
and $\theta$ being the angle between the side of the square and the center
of the circle at the corner.

Each circle will cover $2r\cos\theta$ of one edge and $2r\sin\theta$ of
the other edge.  To have the 4 circles cover the edges, with the middle
covered by the 5th circle, $2r\cos\theta + 2r\sin\theta = 1$, or
$\sin(\theta+\pi/4) =  1/2r\sqrt2$, so
$\theta = \sin^{-1}(1/2r\sqrt2) - \pi/4$.  So, in order to cover the
edges with 4 circles, $r \ge 1/2\sqrt2 = \sqrt2/4$, which is also enough
cover the square without the 5th circle, so there's no point in continuing
this line of thought.

Next, consider having 2 circles cover the bottom edge, with the remaining 3
covering the top edge.  Let $r$ be the radius.  The bottom circles cover
the bottom $2\sqrt{r^2-1/16}$ of the side edges.  Let
$a = 1 - 2\sqrt{r^2-1/16}$.  The upper left and upper right circles will need
to cover the upper $a$ of the side edges, which means they each cover
$2\sqrt{r^2-a^2/4}$ of the top edge, leaving $1-4\sqrt{r^2-a^2/4}$ of the
top edge to be covered by the 5th circle.  Let $b = 1-4\sqrt{r^2-a^2/4}$.
If the 5th circle finishes covering the top edge, the bottom of the 5th
circle will be $r + \sqrt{r^2-b^2/4}$ below the top edge.  For the hole
in the middle to be covered, $r + \sqrt{r^2-b^2/4} \ge a$, which,
[numerically](2022090c.hs), means $r \gtrapprox 0.32616$.

If the radius is $r$, the upper left and lower right circles cover
$2r\sqrt2$ of each edge.

If the upper right and lower left circles cover the remainder of the
upper and left edges, $h = 1 - 2r\sqrt2$, then they cover
$2\sqrt{r^2-h^2/4}$ of the right and bottom edges.

Then, one circle needs to cover the hole in the center and the hole around
the middle of the bottom edge.  If that can be done, another circle certainly
can cover the hole around the middle of the right edge.

Let $a = 1/2 - 2r\sqrt2$ and $b = 1/2 - 2\sqrt{r^2-h^2/4}$.  To cover the
gap in the bottom edge, the center of circle would have to be no more than
$\sqrt{r^2 - (a+b)^2/4}$ above the bottom edge, so the top of the circle
would be $r + \sqrt{r^2 - (a+b)^2/4}$ above the bottom edge, but displaced
horizontally by $|a-b|$ from the center, which is where the top the center
hole is, $1/2 + a$ above the bottom edge.  So the circle would would reach
up to $\sqrt{r^2 - (a-b)^2} + \sqrt{r^2 - (a+b)^2/4}$ on the center line,
giving $\sqrt{r^2 - (a-b)^2} + \sqrt{r^2 - (a+b)^2/4} \ge 1/2 + a$, which,
[numerically](2022090c.hs), means $r \gtrapprox 0.2748$.
