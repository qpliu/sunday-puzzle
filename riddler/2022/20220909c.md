==========================
First, consider having 4 circles covering the 4 corners, with radius $r$,
and $\theta$ being the angle between the side of the square and the center
of the circle at the corner.

Each circle will cover $2r\cos\theta$ of one edge and $2r\sin\theta$ of
the other edge.  To have the 4 circles cover the edges, with the middle
covered by the 5th circle, $2r\cos\theta + 2r\sin\theta = 1$, or
$\sin(\theta+\pi/4) =  1/2r\sqrt2$, so
$\theta = \sin^{-1}(1/2r\sqrt2) - \pi/4$.  So, in order to cover the
edges with 4 circles, $r \ge 1/2\sqrt2 = \sqrt2/4$, which is also enough
cover the square without the 5th circle, so there's no point in continuing
this line of thought.

Next, consider having 2 circles cover the bottom edge, with the remaining 3
covering the top edge.  Let $r$ be the radius, and $\theta$ be the angle
between the bottom edge of the square and the center of the nearest bottom
circle at a bottom corner.  If each bottom circle covers half of the bottom
edge, then $2r\cos\theta = 1/2$, or $\theta = \cos^{-1}(1/4r)$, so
$r \ge 1/4$ to cover the bottom edge, which makes sense.

The bottom circles will also cover the bottom $2r\sin\theta$ of the side
edges, which is
$2r\sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta} = 2r\sqrt{1-1/16r^2} = \frac12\sqrt{16r^2-1}$.
So, in order for the side edges to be covered,
$2r + \frac12\sqrt{16r^2-1} \ge 1$, or
$16r^2-1 \ge (2-4r)^2 = 4 + 16r^2 - 16r$, or $r \ge 5/16$.

The upper side circles must cover the upper $1-\frac12\sqrt{16r^2-1}$ of the
side edges.  Let $h = 1-\frac12\sqrt{16r^2-1}$.  Then, each upper side
circle covers $2\sqrt{r^2-h^2/4}$ of the top edge.

Finally, the middle top circle can be a little higher, with its bottom $h$
from the top of the square, so it covers $2\sqrt{r^2-(h-r)^2}$ of the top
edge.

For the top edge to be covered, $4\sqrt{r^2-h^2/4}+2\sqrt{2rh-h^2} \ge 1$,
which is when $r$ is greater than approximately 0.46, which more than
$\sqrt2/4$, so there is no point in continuing this line of thought.

I'm starting to think that you can't do better than $r = \sqrt2/4$.  Consider
the optimized 4 circles.  Moving a circle further from the center means
moving another closer to the center to fill the center and adding a circle
on the edge is asymmetrical, thus not allowing room for a bigger square.
And using the 5th circle to fill in the center, the first scenario considered,
also does not work.  I suspect the same is true when considering 6 circles.
