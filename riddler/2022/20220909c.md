==========================
First, consider having 4 circles covering the 4 corners, with radius $r$,
and $\theta$ being the angle between the side of the square and the center
of the circle at the corner.

Each circle will cover $2r\cos\theta$ of one edge and $2r\sin\theta$ of
the other edge.  To have the 4 circles cover the edges, with the middle
covered by the 5th circle, $2r\cos\theta + 2r\sin\theta = 1$, or
$\sin(\theta+\pi/4) =  1/2r\sqrt2$, so
$\theta = \sin^{-1}(1/2r\sqrt2) - \pi/4$.  So, in order to cover the
edges with 4 circles, $r \ge 1/2\sqrt2 = \sqrt2/4$, which is also enough
cover the square without the 5th circle, so there's no point in continuing
this line of thought.

Next, consider having 2 circles cover the bottom edge, with the remaining 3
covering the top edge.  Let $r$ be the radius.  The bottom circles cover
the bottom $2\sqrt{r^2-1/16}$ of the side edges.  Let
$a = 1 - 2\sqrt{r^2-1/16}$.  The upper left and upper right circles will need
to cover the upper $a$ of the side edges, which means they each cover
$2\sqrt{r^2-a^2/4}$ of the top edge, leaving $1-4\sqrt{r^2-a^2/4}$ of the
top edge to be covered by the 5th circle.  Let $b = 1-4\sqrt{r^2-a^2/4}$.
If the 5th circle finishes covering the top edge, the bottom of the 5th
circle will be $r + \sqrt{r^2-b^2/4}$ below the top edge.  For the hole
in the middle to be covered, $r + \sqrt{r^2-b^2/4} \ge a$, which,
[numerically](2022090c.hs), means $r \gtrapprox 0.32616$.

If the radius is $r$, the upper left and lower right circles cover
$2r/\sqrt2$ of each edge.

If the upper right and lower left circles cover the remainder of the
upper and left edges, $h = 1 - 2r/\sqrt2$, then they cover
$2\sqrt{r^2-h^2/4}$ of the right and bottom edges.

Then, one circle needs to cover the middle of the bottom edge and at least
half of the center, while the other covers the middle of the right edge and
the rest of the center.

Let $a = 1/2 - 2r/\sqrt2$ and $b = 1/2 - 2\sqrt{r^2-h^2/4}$.  To cover the
gap in the bottom edge, the center of circle would have to be no more than
$\sqrt{r^2 - (a+b)^2/4}$ above the bottom edge while being $1/2-(b-a)/2$ from
the left edge.  In order to cover half of the middle, it would have to cover
the point on the upper left circle that is diametrically opposite to the
upper left corner of the square.  Let $x = 1/2-(b-a)/2$ and
$y = \sqrt{r^2 - (a+b)^2/4}$.  So
$y + \sqrt{r^2 - (x - r\sqrt2)^2} \ge 1 - r\sqrt2$, which,
[numerically](2022090c.hs), means $r \gtrapprox 0.307118$.

But it's possible to do better by having the upper right cover the right
edge and have the 6th circle cover the top edge instead of the right edge.

The intersections of the two middle circles then have be within the corner
circles for the square to be covered, which works out
[numerically](2022090c.hs) to $r \gtrapprox 0.3032269$.
