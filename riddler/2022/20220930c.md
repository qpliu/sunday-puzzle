==========================
The 1 could be opposite any of the other 3 pieces.  If it is opposite the
2 or the 3, then it would be next to the 4, which would mean one of the
cuts must bisect the pizza.  The other cut would have to split the pizza
4:6 if the 1 is opposite the 2, or 3:7 if the 1 is opposite the 3.

If the 1 is opposite the 4, then the two cuts would have to split the pizza
3:7 and 4:6.

If the center of a chord is $r$ from the center of the circle, the angle
spanned by the chord is $2\cos^{-1}r$, and the area within that angle
is $\cos^{-1}r$.  The area of triangle formed by the chord and the
center is $r\sqrt{1-r^2}$, so the smaller side would have area
$\cos^{-1}r - r\sqrt{1-r^2}$.

Using [code](20220930c.hs), to split the pizza 3:7, $r \approx 0.31969$,
and to split the pizza 4:6, $r \approx 0.15774$.

Since having one of the cuts along the diameter is easiest to consider,
consider that first.

If the first cut is along a diameter and the center of the second cut is
$r$ from the center and the cuts intersect at an angle of $\theta$,
where $\theta > \sin^{-1}r$, then the area of the biggest slice would be
the sum of the area spanned by the angle $\pi - \theta + \sin^{-1}r$ and
the area of the triangle with sides of length $1$, $r/\sin\theta$, and
$\sqrt{1-r^2} - r/tan\theta$, which needs to $4\pi/10$,

$$ (\pi - \theta + \sin^{-1}r)/2 + \sqrt{(1+r/\sin\theta+\sqrt{1-r^2}-r/\tan\theta)(-1+r/\sin\theta+\sqrt{1-r^2}-r/\tan\theta)(1-r/\sin\theta+\sqrt{1-r^2}-r/\tan\theta)(1+r/\sin\theta-\sqrt{1-r^2}+r/\tan\theta)/16} = 4\pi/10 $$

If the 1 is opposite the 2, then
$\theta \approx 0.92368 \approx 52.9227\degree$, and the cuts
intersect approximately 0.19771 from the center.

If the 1 is opposite the 3, then
$\theta \approx 1.21914 \approx 69.8515\degree$, and the cuts
intersect approximately 0.34053 from the center.

It would be more complicated to figure out how to cut the 1 opposite
the 4 since the diameter would no longer be a cut.

The extra credit would be still more complicated.
