==========================
The 1 could be opposite any of the other 3 pieces.  If it is opposite the
2 or the 3, then it would be next to the 4, which would mean one of the
cuts must bisect the pizza.  The other cut would have to split the pizza
4:6 if the 1 is opposite the 2, or 3:7 if the 1 is opposite the 3.

If the 1 is opposite the 4, then the two cuts would have to split the pizza
3:7 and 4:6.

If the center of a chord is $r$ from the center of the circle, the angle
spanned by the chord is $2\cos^{-1}r$, and the area within that angle
is $\cos^{-1}r$.  The area of triangle formed by the chord and the
center is $r\sqrt{1-r^2}$, so the smaller side would have area
$\cos^{-1}r - r\sqrt{1-r^2}$.

Let the radius of the pizza be 1.

Using [code](20220930c.hs), to split the pizza 3:7, $r \approx 0.31969$,
and to split the pizza 4:6, $r \approx 0.15774$.

Let the center of one cut be $r_a$ from the center of the pizza, and the
center of the other cut be $r_b$ from the center.  Let $d$ be the distance
of the intersection of the two cuts from the center.  Let $f$ be the fraction
of the pizza of the piece opposite the smallest piece.

When the 1 is opposite the 2, $r_a \approx 0.31969$, $r_b = 0$, and $f = 2/10$.

When the 1 is opposite the 3, $r_a \approx 0.15774$, $r_b = 0$, and $f = 3/10$.

When the 1 is opposite the 4, $r_a \approx 0.31969, $r_b \approx 0.157744, and
$f = 4/10$.

The piece opposite the smallest piece is the piece containing
the center, the area of which is the sum of the area of the sector beween
where the cuts intersect the edge, the area of the two triangles with
vertices where a cut intersect the edge, at the center, and at the center of
the cut, and the area of the two triangles with vertices at the center of a
cut, at the center, and where the cuts intersect.

The area of the sector is

$$ \frac{2\pi - \cos^{-1}r_a - \cos^{-1}r_b - \cos^{-1}(r_a/d) - \cos^{-1}(r_b/d)}2 $$

The area of two of the triangles is

$$ \frac{r_a\sqrt{1-r_a^2} + r_b\sqrt{1-r_b}}2 $$

The area of the other two triangles is

$$ \frac{r_a\sqrt{d^2-r_a^2} + r_b\sqrt{d^2-r_b}}2 $$

The two cuts intersect at an angle of

$$ \sin^{-1}(r_a/d) + \sin^{-1}(r_b/d) $$

To determine the cuts, solve

$$ \2\pi - \cos^{-1}r_a - \cos^{-1}r_b - \cos^{-1}(r_a/d) - \cos^{-1}(r_b/d) + r_a\sqrt{1-r_a^2} + r_b\sqrt{1-r_b} + r_a\sqrt{d^2-r_a^2} + r_b\sqrt{d^2-r_b} = 2\pi f $$

for $d$.

Solving [numerically](20220930c.hs), when the 2 is opposite the 1,
the cuts are 0 and 0.15774 from the center, intersecting 0.19771 from the
center at an angle of 0.92376 or 52.923 degrees.

When the 3 is opposite the 1, the cuts are 0 and 0.31969 from the center,
intersecting 0.34531 from the center at an angle of 1.21914 or 69.851 degrees.

When the 4 is opposite the 1, the cuts are 0.15774 and 0.31969 from the center,
intersecting 0.37509 from the center at an angle of 1.45440 or 83.331 degrees.

The extra credit looks difficult.
