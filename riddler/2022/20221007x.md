==========================
2031 is the next year with 4 distinct digits, but the hour needs 0 or 1,
and with 1, it needs 0, 1, or 2, so the next possible year is 2134.  The
earliest hour would be 05, but the minutes and seconds can only take two
of 6, 7, 8, or 9, unless there is a leap second, which I will rule out,
so the year must be 2136, the hour must be 07, the minute must be 48 and
the second must be 59.
