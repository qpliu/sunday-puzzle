==========================
Since the two pieces cannot be longer than 10 squares, the top two
rows must be in one piece, and the bottom two rows must be in the other
piece.  I think no 1x1 square needs to be cut, though if any did, it would
be diagonally.  Maybe one of the pieces will need to be flipped over.

To make a 10x10 square the 9x2 rows need a 1x2 section from the other
piece.
