==========================
The fidget spinner would appear to spin backwards when spinning slightly
slower than a multiple of 60 revolutions per second.  Since each lobe has
a different color, the number of lobes is irrelevant.  If all the lobes
were the same color, it would appear to spin backwards at slightly less
than multiples of 12 revolutions per second.

So the fidget spinner had to start at around at least 180 revolutions per
second, but also significantly slower than 240 revolutions per second.
Based on the number of lobes, say the upper limit is about 228 revolutions
per second.

If all the lobes were the same color, it had to start at between about 36
and significantly slower than 48 revolutions per second.

Extra credit
------------
To appear to spin backwards the additional times, it would have to be
spinning slightly slower than 30 revolutions per second plus a multiple
of 60 revolutions per second, so it had to start at between about 180
and about 198 revolutions per second.

If all the lobes were the same color, it had to start at between about 36
and 42 revolutions per second.
