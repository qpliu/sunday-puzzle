==========================
Since there will be at least 50 trick-or-treaters, the strategy determines
how many pieces of candy, from 0 to 100, remain after the 50th.  The details
of the strategy for the first 50 don't otherwise matter.

Considering the extremes, giving 1 candy each, there will be 100 pieces
remaining after the first 50, and $X = 50$, all leftovers.  Giving 3 candies
each, there will be 0 pieces remaining after the first 50, and $X = 50$,
all running out.

Playing around with various strategies with [code](20221028c.hs),
giving 2 candies each, there will be 50 pieces remaining after the first
50, and $X = 3500/101 \approx 34.6535$.

Giving 2 candies to each of the first 50, then 1 each thereafter, there
will be 50 pieces remaining after the first 50, and
$X = 2550/101 \approx 25.2475$.  If there were 49 pieces after the first
50 or if there were 51 pieces after the first 50, giving 1 piece each
after the first 50, $X = 2551/101$.

If there were 51 pieces after the first 50, giving 2 pieces to the 51st
then 1 each afterwards, $X = 2551/101$.  Giving 1 piece to the 51st, 2 pieces
to the 52nd, then 1 each afterwards, $X = 2552/101$.

It's looking like there is a minimum at $X = 2550/101$.

Since the expected number of trick-or-treaters is 100, it would make sense
for the strategy to run out after the first 100.

If there are 100 pieces after the first 50, and the strategy gives 2 pieces
to each of the next 50, $X = 3825/101$.

It looks like the best strategy would be to give 100 pieces to the first 50
trick-or-treaters, then one piece each to the next 50, running out after the
100th, for $X = 2550/101 \approx 25.2475$.
