==========================
Let $t = 0$ be the equinox and $t = 1$ be the solstice.

I'll assume the distribution of color changing times is flat, $C(t) = 1$.

I'll assume that the distribution of leaf falling times for trees that
changed color at $t = t_C$ is also flat, $F(t_C, t) = H(t - t_C)/(1 - t_C)$.

The fraction of trees that changed color between
$t = t_C$ and $t = t_C + dt$ is $C(t_C)dt = dt$.

At time $t$, of the trees that changed color at $t_C < t$, the fraction that
still have leaves is $\int_t^1 dt F(t_C,t) = \frac{1-t}{1-t_C}$.

Integrating over $t_C$, $\int_0^t dt_C \frac{1-t}{1-t_C} = -(1-t)\ln(1-t)$
is the fraction of trees that have changed color and still have leaves.

The extremum is at $t = 1-1/e \approx 0.6321$.

In 2022, equinox was Sep 22, and winter solstice will be Dec 22,
making Nov 18 the day with the most leaves that have changed color.
