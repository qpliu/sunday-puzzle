There is 1/4 chance that the two points are on the same side, which cannot
make a reasonable slice.

There is a 2/4 chance that the two points are on adjacent sides, with
probability $p_a$ of being reasonable.

There is a 1/4 chance that the two points are on opposite sides, with
probability $p_o$ of being reasonable.

The overall probability of being reasonable is $p = p_a/2 + p_o/4$.

Points on adjacent sides
------------------------
Let $x$ and $y$ be the distances of the points from their common corner.
The smaller piece will always be the one with the common corner, with
area $xy/2$.

$$ p_a = \int_0^1 dx \int_0^1 dy\ H(xy/2 - 1/4)
       = \int_{1/2}^1 dx \int_{1/2x}^1 dy
       = \int_{1/2}^1 dx\ (1 - 1/2x)
       = \frac{1 - \ln 2}2 $$

Points on opposite sides
------------------------
Dividing both sides in half, there is 1/2 chance that the two points
are on opposite halves, which always makes a reasonable slice.

There is a 1/2 chance the the two points on are on the same half, with
probability $p_s$ of being reasonable.

That makes $p_o = 1/2 + p_s/2$.

Let $x$ and $y$ be the distances of the points from their closest corners,
making the area of the smaller piece $(x+y)/2$.

$$ p_s = 4\int_0^{1/2} dx \int_0^{1/2} dy\ H((x+y)/2 - 1/4)
       = 4\int_0^{1/2} dx \int_{1/2-x}^{1/2} dy
       = 4\int_0^{1/2} dx\ x = 1/2 $$

That means $p_o = 3/4$.

Overall
-------
The overall probability of being reasonable is
$p = \frac{7 - 4\ln 2}{16} \approx 0.2642$.
