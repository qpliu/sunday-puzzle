==========================
Let $\theta$ be the angle of the pole from vertical.  The gravitational
potential energy is proportional to $\cos\theta$, so the kinetic energy
is proportional to $1 - \cos\theta$, and the horizontal velocity is
proportional to $\cos\theta\sqrt{1-\cos\theta}$.

Maximizing with respect to $\theta$, $\cos\theta = 2/3$, so
$\sin\theta = \sqrt{5/9}$.

That means the maximizing distance is $100\sqrt{5/9} \approx 74.5$ feet.
