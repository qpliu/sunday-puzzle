==========================
Let $s$ be the fraction of runners that are slower, and $f$ be the fraction
of runners that start farther ahead.  Since $s$ and $f$ are independent of
each other, the fraction of runners that will be passed is $sf$.

On average,

$$ \langle sf\rangle = \int_0^1 ds \int_0^1 df\ sf = 1/4 $$
