If there are $m$ American fans and $n$ Dutch fans, there is $m/(m+n)$ chance
that the next bus will take Americans, and $n/(m+n)$ chance that the next bus
will take Dutch.

If the bus takes Americans, there is a $n/(m+n-1)$ chance that the bus will
take 1 American, a $(m-1)n/((m+n-1)(m+n-2))$ that the bus will take 2
Americans, a $(m-1)(m-2)n/((m+n-1)(m+n-2)(m+n-3))$ chance that the bus
will take 3 Americans, etc.

Using [code](20221202c.hs), the chance that the last shuttle takes Americans
is 1/2.  There must be some way to reason out this result.

If there are $m$ American fans and $n$ Dutch fans, where $m > 0$ and $n > 0$,
the chance that the next bus will take all the American fans is

$$ \product_{p=0}^{m-1} \frac{m-p}{m+n-p} = \frac{m!n!}{(m+n)!}$$

which is the same as the chance that the next bus will take all the
Dutch fans.

So, no matter what $m$ and $n$ are, as long as $m > 0$ and $n > 0$, if the
next bus is the last bus, the chances are equal between taking Americans and
Dutch in the last bus, so the chance that the last bus takes Americans must
be 1/2.

Using code, the average number of buses is 34461937513/3610326720, or about
9.5454.
