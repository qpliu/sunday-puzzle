==========================
If there are $m$ American fans and $n$ Dutch fans, there is $m/(m+n)$ chance
that the next bus will take Americans, and $n/(m+n)$ chance that the next bus
will take Dutch.

If the bus takes Americans, there is a $n/(m+n-1)$ chance that the bus will
take 1 American, a $(m-1)n/((m+n-1)(m+n-2))$ that the bus will take 2
Americans, a $(m-1)(m-2)n/((m+n-1)(m+n-2)(m+n-3))$ chance that the bus
will take 3 Americans, etc.

Using [code](20221202c.hs), the chance that the last shuttle takes Americans
is 1/2.  There must be some way to reason out this result.

Extra credit
------------
Using code, the average number of buses is 34461937513/3610326720, or about
9.5454.
