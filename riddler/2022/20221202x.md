==========================
Consider aiming for the opposite corner.  The third hit will be in the
starting corner after going $\sqrt8$ meters.

Consider aiming for bouncing off an opposite side into an adjacent corner.
The third hit will be in that adjacent corner after going $\sqrt5$ meters.

Consider aiming for bouncing off an opposite side, then an adjacent side
into the opposite corner.  The third hit will be in the opposite corner
after going $\sqrt{10}$ meters.

Consider bouncing off of both opposite sides.  The third hit will be on
an adjacent side.  Let the first hit be $x$ from the opposite corner, where
$x < 1/2$.  It will go $\sqrt{(1-x)^2+1}$ before the first
hit.  It will go the same distance between the first hit and third hit
for a total of $2\sqrt{(1-x)^2+1}$, which decreases from $\sqrt8$
to $\sqrt5$ as $x$ increases from 0 to 1/2.

So the farthest the ball can go is $\sqrt{10}$ meters.

------------
If $N$ is even, the last hit will be in an adjacent corner.  If $N$ is
odd, the last hit will be in the opposite corner.  Between each hit,
the it will go $\sqrt{1/N^2+1}$ for a total of $\sqrt{N^2+1}$.
