==========================
Rather than thinking, just write some brute-force [code](20221209x.hs).

The 6 games are A-B, C-D, A-C, B-D, A-D, B-C, each with 3 possible
outcomes.  Keep only the results where A ends up with more points
than B, B ends up with more points than C, and C ends up with more
points that D.

There are 13 outcomes that satisfy the conditions:
* 9-6-3-0
* 9-4-3-1
* 9-4-2-1
* 7-6-4-0
* 7-6-3-1
* 7-6-2-1
* 7-5-4-0
* 7-5-3-1
* 7-5-2-1
* 7-4-3-2
* 7-4-3-1
* 6-5-4-1
* 5-4-3-2
