==========================
If there are $n$ people in a round, there will be at least 2 unique names
and up to $n$ unique names in the hat.

If there are 2 people left, there is only 1 possible combination of names
in the hat.  The probability that they select each other is 1/2, so expected
number of rounds is 2.

$$ R(1) = 1 + R(1)/2 = 2 $$

If there are 4 people left,

|names  |probability|no match|1 match|2 matches|
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
|3:1:0:0|12/81      |18/24   |6/24   |0        |
|2:2:0:0|12/81      |16/24   |8/24   |0        |
|2:1:1:0|48/81      |14/24   |10/24  |0        |
|1:1:1:1|9/81       |15/24   |6/24   |3/24     |

The expected number of rounds is

$$ R(2) = 1 + (\frac{12}{81}\frac{18}{24} + \frac{12}{81}\frac{16}{24} + \frac{48}{81}\frac{14}{24} + \frac{9}{81}\frac{15}{24})R(2) + (\frac{12}{81}\frac{6}{24} + \frac{12}{81}\frac{8}{24} + \frac{48}{81}\frac{10}{24} + \frac{9}[81}\frac{6}{24})R(1) = 1 + \frac{5R(2)}{8} + \frac{13R(1)}{36} = \frac{124}{27} \approx 4.593 $$

At this point, I'll write some [simulation code](20221216c.go) to get
an idea of what the answer should be.

|pairs|expected rounds|
|-----|---------------|
|1    |1.9992         |
|2    |4.5909         |
|3    |6.9519         |
|4    |9.2218         |
|5    |11.4341        |
|6    |13.6086        |
|7    |15.7568        |
|8    |17.8837        |
