==========================
The first few terms would be $a$, $b$, $c$, $a+b+c$, $a+2b+2c$, $2a+3b+4c$,
$4a+6b+7c$, $6a+11b+13b$, ...

Rather than thinking more, just write some brute-force [code](20221216x.hs).

A few 2023 sequences are (1,1,6), (1,6,8), (6,8,15), (2,7,39), (5,11,34),
and the one with the smallest 4th term is
1,1,6,8,15,29,52,96,177,325,598,1100,2023,...

Note that (1,6,8), (6,8,15), and others are (1,1,6) after dropping some
leading terms.
