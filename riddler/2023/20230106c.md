==========================
I expect the answer will be to make assemblers for $6n$ days, resulting in
$2^n$ assemblers, then make fighters for the remaining $100-6n$ days, which
will result in $(2400-144n) \times 2^n$ fighters.

Building a fighter before starting to build the last assembler will always
result in fewer fighters after the last assembler is built than building
the last assembler, then building 2 fighters afterwards.

After 90 days, an assembler could make 240 fighters, or make an assembler,
then, after 96 days, two assemblers could make 192 fighters.

After 84 days, an assembler could make 384 fighters, or make an assembler,
then, after 90 days, two assemblers could make 480 fighters.

After making assemblers for 90 days, there are $2^{15}$ assemblers, which
then make 7864320 fighters in the next 10 days, which is the greatest
number of fighters that could be made in the 100 days.
