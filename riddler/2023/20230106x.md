==========================
62 would have at least as many ways as 60.  So would 63 and 64.  And any
$N > 64$ would have more ways, so 61 is the only candidate greater than
60.

Since 60 could be scored with 0, 2, 4, ... or 20 3-pointers, there are 21 ways
to score 60.

And 61 could be scored with 1, 3, ... or 19 3-pointers, so there are 19 ways
to score 61.
