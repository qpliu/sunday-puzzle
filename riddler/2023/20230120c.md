==========================
Assuming each delivery involves starting from and ending at the restaurant,
the time needed to deliver to a location at angle $\theta$ for a scooter
is $\sin\theta + \cos\theta$, while the time for the drone is $1$.

Integrating over $\theta$ from $0$ to $\pi/4$, the average time per delivery
for a scooter is $4/\pi$, versus $1$ for the drone.

So a drone would make $4/\pi \approx 1.27$ deliveries for every scooter
delivery on average.

------------
For $0 \le \theta \le \pi/8$, the time needed for the scooter is
$\cos\theta-\sin\theta + \sqrt2\sin\theta$.

Integrating over $\theta$ from $0$ to $\pi/8$ gives
$8/\pi (\sin(\pi/8) + (\sqrt2-1)(1-\cos(\pi/8))) \approx 1.05$, which
is how many deliveries a drone would make for every scooter delivery
on average.
