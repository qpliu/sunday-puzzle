==========================
If the first letter is A or Z, then they can be placed
with no chance of losing on the second letter.

For the first letter, I'll assume that putting A-E in the first
slot, F-J in the second slot, K-P in the third slot, Q-U in the
fourth slot, and V-Z in the fifth slot is the best strategy.

Due to symmetry, the chance of winning is the same if the letters
A-Z are reversed to Z-A and the slots are reversed, which should
help speed up the calculation.

Using [code](20230127c.hs), the probabilities add up to a 1937942/7893600,
or about 24.55%, chance of winning.
