Extra credit
------------
Define fair as minimizing the difference in expected points with the same
conditions from the sector with the maximum expected points and the sector
with the minimum expected points.  (Minimizing the variance would be
another possibility.)

Having 20-1-19 gives 10 1/4 for 1.  Having 2-20-1 gives 10 3/4 for 20.

Building out from 2-20-1-19 gives

10, 12, 8, 14, 6, 16, 4, 18, 2, 20, 1, 19, 3, 17, 5, 15, 7, 13, 9, 11

with 10 1/4 as the least expected score and 10 3/4 as the greatest expected
score.
