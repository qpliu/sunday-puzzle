==========================
The density of stars is constant with respect to the angle of elevation.

The density of planes is greatest near the horizon and least directly
overhead.

Let $h = 6/4000$.

Let $\Theta$ be the angle at the center of the Earth from the observation
point to the point of light.

Looking at a plane directly overhead, $\phi_0 = \pi/2$ and $\Theta_0 = 0$.

Looking at a plane on the horizon, $\phi_1 = 0$ and
$\cos\Theta_1 = 1/(1+h)$,
$\sin\Theta_1 = \sqrt{(2h+h^2)/(1+h)^2}$, and
$\Theta_1 \approx 0.054738$.

Working out the angle of elevation, $\phi$, gives

$$ \phi = \frac\pi2 - \Theta - \tan^{-1}\frac{\sin\Theta}{h+1-\cos\Theta} $$

The density of planes is

$$ \rho(\phi) = -\frac{d\Theta}{d\phi} $$

The average density is

$$ \rho_a = \frac2\pi\int_0^{\pi/2} d\phi\rho(\phi) $$

The angle of elevation, $\phi_a$, is the solution of

$$ \rho_a = \rho(\phi_a) $$.

The average density is

$$ \rho_a = \frac2\pi\int_0^{\pi/2} d\phi\rho(\phi) = \frac2\pi\int_{\Theta_1}^0 d\Theta \frac{d\phi}{d\Theta} \rho = \frac{2\Theta_1}\pi $$

Solving for $\Theta_a$,

$$ \frac{2\Theta_1}\pi = 1 + \frac{1}{1+\alpha^2}\frac{d\alpha}{d\Theta} $$

where

$$ \alpha = \frac{\sin\Theta}{h/R+1-\cos\Theta} $$

$$ \frac{d\alpha}{d\Theta} = \frac{\cos\Theta}{h/R+1-\cos\Theta} - \frac{\sin^2\Theta}{(h/R+1-\cos\Theta)^2} = \frac{h/R \cos\Theta}{(h/R+1-\cos\Theta)^2} $$

[Numerically](20230210c.hs) solving gives $\phi_a \approx 0.01838958$, or about
1.05365 degrees.
