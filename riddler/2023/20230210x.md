==========================
$b$ must be multiple of 2.  $a$ must be greater than zero.  Given a solution
$a, b$, then $a, -b$ is also a solution.

$$ a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a - b^2 - 4 = 0 $$

There are 3 roots.

$$ (a - r) (a - s) (a - t) = 0 $$

$$ a^3 - (r+s+t)a^2 + (rs + st + rt)c - rst = 0 $$

Giving

$$ r + s + t = 3 $$

$$ rs + st + tr = 2 $$

$$ rst = b^2 + 4 $$

Consider only cases where at least one root is an integer.  And checking
small integers ($a < 1000000$, $b < 30000000$) shows that there no solutions
with small integers.

If all three roots are real, two of them must be negative, and one
must be positive, and negative roots are not possible.

If two of the roots are complex, they must be complex conjugates, and their
real part must be negative.

$$ st = 2 - r(s + t) = 2 - r(3 - r) $$

and plugging that in just restates the original problem.

I give up.
