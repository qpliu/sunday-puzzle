==========================
For a (pretty useless) lower bound, an ellipse with the area of the three
smaller ellipses would have a major axis of $2\sqrt3 \approx 3.464$.

For an upper bound, consider the case where all the ellipses have the
same orientation, which is equivalent to circles.  Three circles with
radius 1 can be contained by a circle with radius $1 + 2/\sqrt3$, and
squashing them into ellipses makes the major axis of the containing
ellipse $2+4/\sqrt3 \approx 4.309$.

Since $1+2/\sqrt3 > 2$, it's possible to orient the major axis of one
of the ellipses along the minor axis of the containing ellipse.  It
then may be possible (I do not have a proof) to fit an ellipse on either
side of the center ellipse.  If so, it may be possible to shrink the
containing ellipse to have a major axis of 4 and still contain the 3
ellipses.  If that is possible, it may then be possible to rotate the
center ellipse (as well as rotating and shifting the ellipses beside it)
to further shrink the containing ellipse.  Visualizing this, if the
middle ellipse shares its center with that of the containing ellipse,
there is only $2/sqrt3 \approx 1.155$ along the major axis for another
ellipse, so the major axes of other two ellipses would have to be close
to parallel to the minor axis of the containing ellipse.  Imagining this
visualization, it seems plausible, by shoving the middle ellipse along its
major axis to the edge of the containing ellipse and tilting the opposite
side of the other two ellipses towards the middle, that the major axis of
the containing ellipse could be made slightly smaller than $2+4/\sqrt3$,
but not anywhere close to $4$.
