==========================
I don't see the relevance of the two semifinal heats, so just consider
the top 9 for a heat.  Suppose that the top 5 get no intermediate sprint
points, leaving 21 points for the next 4.  It's possible for all 4 of them
to get 5 points, leaving 1 point for a 10th, or for 1 of them to get 6
points and the other 3 getting 5 points.  In either case, the 9th gets
5 points.
