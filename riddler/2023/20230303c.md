2023-03-03 Riddler Classic
==========================
If the best team in the left bracket is the champion, and the best team
in the right bracket is the runner-up, the champion is always the best
team overall, while the runner-up can be the 2nd best, the 3rd best, ...
all the way to the $2^{N-1}+1$, or worse than every team in the left bracket.

Each side of the bracket has $2^{N-1}$ teams, with $R(N-1)$ possible rankings.
Then, there are $R(N) = R(N-1)^2 F(2^{N-1}-1,2^{N-1})$ possible rankings,
where $F(n,m)$ is the number of ways to combine $n$ ordered teams and $m$
ordered teams into an overall ranking.

The best team on the right side of the bracket could be better than all the
teams on the left side of the bracket, or worse than all of the teams on the
left side of the bracket, or anywhere in between.

$$ F(n,m) = F(n,m-1) + F(n-1,m-1) + F(n-2,m-1) + \ldots + F(2,m-1) + F(1,m-1) + F(0,m-1) $$

If the best team on the right side of the bracket is worse than the worst team
on the left side of the bracket, there is only one possible ranking.

$$ F(0,m) = 1 $$

For an 8-team bracket, $R(3) = R(2)^2 F(3,4)$.  $R(2) = 3$, and $F(3,4) = 35$,
so there are 315 possible rankings.

------------
If there are $2^N$ teams, there are $R(N) = R(N-1)^2 F(2^{N-1}-1,2^{N-1})$
possible rankings.

For $F$, it's number of ways $n$ and $m$ cards can be shuffled together.
So, $F(n,m) = {{n+m} \choose m}$.

$$ R(N) = R(N-1)^2 {{2^N-1}\choose{2^{N-1}}} = {{2^{N-1}-1}\choose{2^{N-2}}}^2R(N-2)^2 {{2^N-1}\choose{2^{N-1}}} $$

$$ R(N) = \prod_{n=0}^{N-1} {{2^{N-n}-1}\choose{2^{N-n-1}}}^{2^n} $$

For a 16-team bracket, there are 638512875 possible rankings.

For a 32-team bracket, there are 122529844256906551386796875 possible rankings.

For a 64-team bracket, there are
