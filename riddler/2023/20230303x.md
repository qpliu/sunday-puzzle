==========================
Since last two digits have to recur in no more than 10000 iterations, I'll
have some [code](20230303x.hs) tabulate them.

And it recurs after 200 iterations, and 03, 28, 53, and 78, each appearing
5% of the time, are the most common, and 00, 01, 05, 06, 10, 11, 15, 16, 20,
21, 25, 26, 30, 31, 35, 36 40, 41, 45, 46, 50, 51, 55, 56, 60, 61, 65, 66,
70, 71, 75, 76, 80, 81, 85, 86, 90, 91, 95, 96 each appear 2% of the time, and
everything else does not appear.
