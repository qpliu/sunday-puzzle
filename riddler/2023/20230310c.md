==========================
The lower the marble is, the greater its kinetic energy, and the faster
it goes.  However, making the track go lower means making it longer.
This looks like calculus of variations, which I haven't thought about in
decades.

I'll neglect the rotational inertia of the marble, which should not affect
the track design, but would affect the time.  The frictionless track means
there wouldn't be any rotation anyhow.

Let $H(x)$ be the height of the track, $h = 0.1$ be the height at the
start and end.  The kinetic energy of the marble is $mv^2/2 = mg(h-H(x))$.

Let $v_x$ be horizontal speed of the marble and $v_y$ be the vertical
speed.

$$ \frac{v_y}{v_x} = \frac{dH}{dx} $$

$$ \frac12v_x^2(1 + \frac1{(dH/dx)^2}) = g(h-H) $$

$$ \frac{dx}{dt} = \sqrt{\frac{g(h-H)}{1 + \frac1{(dH/dx)^2}}} $$

I'll quit here.
