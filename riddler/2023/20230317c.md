==========================
Initially, I'll just ignore the difference between a straight and a straight
flush.  After figuring that out, I can calculate the probability of a straight
flush and subtract that from the probability of a straight.

The probability of a full house should be easier to calculate.

Some [code](20230317x.hs) will do the calculations.

The probability of a full house is less than a straight when there are
13 or fewer suits.  When there are 14 or more suits, the probability of
a full house is more.

At 13 suits, full house is approximately 0.339%,
straight is approximately 0.343%.

At 14 suits, full house is approximately 0.345%,
straight is approximately 0.342%.

When there are many suits,
full house approaches 120/28561, approximately 0.420%,
straight approaches 1200/371293, approximately 0.323%.
