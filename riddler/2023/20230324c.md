==========================
If every game is a tossup, then every outcome is equally likely.  The
first 4 games are irrelevant, since they are both either 11 or 16 seeds
in each game.

There are 4 groups of seedings: 1-16-8-9, 2-15-7-10, 3-14-6-11, 4-13-5-12,
each of which are independent.

In each group of seedings, each region has 8 possible outcomes:
for example, 1 over 8, 1 over 9, 16 over 8, 16 over 9, 8 over 1, 8 over 16,
9 over 1, 9 over 16, which results in 4 possible winners, each equally
probable.

So the probability that winner of the group in each region is a different
seed is $1 \cdot 3/4 \cdot 2/4 \cdot 1/4 = 3/32$.

There are 4 groups of seedings, so the probability that each group has
a different seed from each region is $3^4/32^4 = 81/1048576$,
7.724761962890625e-5, or about 0.007725%.
