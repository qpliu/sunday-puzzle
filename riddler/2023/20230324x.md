==========================
The minimum bet for Karen was 6000, to end up with either 17400 or 5400.

The minimum bet for Melissa was 5700, to end up with either 14400 or 1500.

So the maximum bet for Zach was 7200-5400 = 1800.

Since ties go to all who tied, there isn't the customary extra 1 dollar.

Extra credit
------------
Zach only wins if both Karen and Melissa get it wrong.

Karen's probability of winning is $p$, since, if she gets it wrong,
either Melissa or Zach wins.  Integrating gives 1/2.

Melissa's probability of winning is $(1-p)p$, since Karen must get it
wrong and Melissa must get it right.  Integrating gives 1/6.

Zach's probability of winning is $(1-p)^2$.  Integrating gives 1/3.
