The shaded triangle has area $ab$.

The big triangle has area $cp/2$.

As $b$ approaches $a$, $p$ and $q$ go to infinity.  As $a$ approaches $0$,
$p$ approaches $0$ and $q$ approaches $b$.

Trigonometric approach
----------------------
Let $\pi/2 > \alpha > \beta$ be the angles of the triangle.

The angles of the big triangle are $\pi/2 > 2\beta > \pi/2-2\beta$.

The angles of the white triangle are
$\pi/2-\alpha$, $\pi-\alpha$, $\pi/2-2\beta$.

It doesn't look like the trigonometric angle addition formulas depend on the
Pythagorean theorem.

$$ \sin(\pi/2-2\beta) = c/q = \cos(2\beta) = \cos^2\beta - \sin^2\beta = b^2/c^2 - a^2/c^2 $$

$$ q = c^3/(b^2-a^2) $$

As $a$ approaches $b$, $q$ goes to infinity.
As $a$ approaches $0$, $b$ approaches $c$, so $q$ approaches $b$.
So this gets the limits right.

$$ \cos(\pi/2-2\beta) = p/q = \sin(2\beta) = 2\sin\beta\cos\beta = 2ab/c^2 $$

$$ p = abc/(b^2-a^2) $$

As $a$ approaches $b$, $p$ goes to infinity.
As $a$ approaches $0$, $b$ approaches $c$, so $p$ approaches $0$.
So this gets the limits right.

Not getting anywhere with this.  Give up for now.
