==========================
Considering an equilateral hexagon with side length 1 plus its center,
either two points points with distance of 1 apart or distance $\sqrt3$ apart
must have the same color.  That doesn't quite work.

Need to find three points on a unit circle that must all have different
colors.  With the center of the circle, that's four points.
The remaining three points are used to force the three points to have
different colors unless any pair of the six points have the same color
and are separated by exactly 1.

If two of the points on centered the unit circle are separated by 1, they
form an equilateral triangle with the center of the unit circle and must
all have different colors.

The task is to find three points that force another point on the unit
circle to be the same color as the center of the circle.

Giving up for now.
