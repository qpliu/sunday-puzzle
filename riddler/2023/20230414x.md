==========================
Take a rhombus with side length 1 and one axis of length 1, making the
length of the other axis $\sqrt3$.  Either a pair of the vertices that are
1 apart have the same color, or the two that are $\sqrt3$ apart have the
same color.  Rotate the rhombus around one of those two vertices by
$2\sin^{-1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}$, making another rhombus.  If no pair of
vertices that are 1 apart in either rhombus have the same color, then
the two vertices that are $\sqrt3$ from the fixed vertex must have the
same color as the fixed vertex, and the distance between those two is 1.
