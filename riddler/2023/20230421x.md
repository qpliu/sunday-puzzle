==========================
With 5 slots, there are two ways to remove one from an end
(`_XOOO` and `OOOX_`), two ways to remove one from next to the end (`X_XOO`
and `OOX_X`), and one way to remove one from the middle (`OX_XO`).

In any case, if the last two are adjacent, either choice is bad luck.

* After removing the first: `_XOOO` (or `OOOX_`): 4 ways
** After removing the second: `_X_XO`: 1 way
*** After removing the third: `_O_X_` : 1 way
** After removing the second: `_OX_X`: 1 way
*** After removing the third: `__X_O`: 1 way
** After removing the second: `_OOX_`: 0 ways
*** After removing the third: `__XO_`: 0 ways
*** After removing the third: `_X_X_`: 0 ways
* After removing the first: `X_XOO` (or `OOX_X`): 6 ways
** After removing the second: `O_X_X`: 2 ways
*** After removing the third: `__O_O`: 2 ways
** After removing the second: `O_OX_`: 1 way
*** After removing the third: `__OO_`: 0 ways
*** After removing the third: `O__X_`: 1 way
* After removing the first: `OX_XO`: 4 ways
** After removing the second: `_X_OO` (or `OO_X_`): 4 ways
*** After removing the third: `_O_X_`: 1 way
*** After removing the third: `_O__X`: 1 way

That's 14 ways.
