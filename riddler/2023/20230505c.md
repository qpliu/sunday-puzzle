==========================
For $k$ flips, there are $n\choose k$ outcomes with probability
$p^n(1-p)^(k-n)$, where $n \in \lbrace 0,1 \ldots k \rbrace$.  Since there is
symmetry between $p$ and $1-p$, consider $p \ge 1/2$.

The most probable outcome is all heads at $p^k$, so $p \le 1/6^{1/k}$.

I postulate that it could be done with 5 flips.  One group with the all heads
and the no heads outcomes, plus five groups, each with one 1 head outcome, two
2 heads outcomes, two 3 heads outcomes, and one 4 heads outcome.

That means

$$ p^5 + (1-p)^5 = 1/6 $$

and

$$ p^4(1-p) + 2p^3(1-p)^2 + 2p^2(1-p)^3 + p(1-p)^4 = 1/6 $$

Both have roots at $p \approx 0.69666$ and $p \approx 0.30334$.
