==========================
For $k$ flips, there are $n\choose k$ outcomes with probability
$p^n(1-p)^(k-n)$, where $n \in \lbrace 0,1 \ldots k \rbrace$.  Since there is
symmetry between $p$ and $1-p$, consider $p \ge 1/2$.

The most probable outcome is all heads at $p^k$, so $p \le 1/6^{1/k}$.

I postulate that it could be done with 5 flips.  One group with the all heads
and the no heads outcomes, plus five groups, each with one 1 head outcome, two
2 heads outcomes, two 3 heads outcomes, and one 4 heads outcome.

That means

$$ p^5 + (1-p)^5 = 1/6 $$

and

$$ p^4(1-p) + 2p^3(1-p)^2 + 2p^2(1-p)^3 + p(1-p)^4 = 1/6 $$

Both have roots at $p \approx 0.69666$ and $p \approx 0.30334$.

To get a closed-form expression, let $p = 1/2 + q$, then, for the
all heads and no heads group,

$$ (1/2+q)^5 + (1/2-q)^5 = 1/6 $$

which reduces to

$$ 240q^4 + 120q^2 - 5 = 0 $$

and choosing the positive root

$$ q^2 = \frac{2\sqrt3 - 3}{12} $$

For the other five groups,

$$ (1/2+q)^4(1/2-q) + 2(1/2+q)^3(1/2-q)^2 + 2(1/2+q)^2(1/2-q)^3 + (1/2+q)(1/2-q)^4 = 1/6 $$

which reduces to

$$ 96q^4 + 48q^2 - 2 = 0 $$

which also has a positive root at

$$ q^2 = \frac{2\sqrt3 - 3}{12} $$

This means

$$ p = \frac12 \pm \sqrt{\frac{2\sqrt3 - 3}{12}} \approx 0.69666, 0.30334 $$
