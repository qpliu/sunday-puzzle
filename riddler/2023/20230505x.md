==========================
After the first jump, the distance is 1/2.

After the second jump, the distance on average is still 1/2.

Since none of the subsequent jumps can cross the origin, the distance on
average will remain 1/2 after each subsequent jump.

Extra credit
------------
After the first jump, the distance is 2/3.

The total length jumped is 2, so the total length of all the subsequent jumps
is 4/3, which could cross the origin.

If the second jump is away from the origin, the distance is 10/9 and none
of the subsequent jumps will cross the origin, so the distance on average
will be 10/9, with probability 1/2.

If the second jump is towards the origin, the distance is 2/9, and the
total length of all subsequent jumps is 8/9.  The distance is 18/81,
with the next jump 16/81, and the total length of subsequent jumps is
72/81.

If the third jump is away from the origin, the distance is 34/81, and the
total length of all subsequent jumps is 56/81.

If the distance after the $N$th jump is $d$, the total length of all
subsequent jumps is $s = 2^{N+1}/3^N$.  If $s \le d$, then the expected
distance is $D(N,d) = d$.  Otherwise, if $d \ge 2^N/3^N$, the expected
distance is $D(N,d) = D(N+1,d+2^N/3^N)/2 + D(N+1,d-2^N/3^N)/2$.  Otherwise,
jumping towards the origin crosses the origin, and the expected distance
is $D(N,d) = D(N+1,d+2^N/3^N)/2 + D(N+1,2^N/3^N-d)/2$.

I'm not seeing how to evaluate this analytically, so I'll evaluate it
[numerically](20230505x.hs) for finite numbers of jumps.  It looks like
it converges to approximately 0.7411983.
