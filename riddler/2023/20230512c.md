Let $N$ be 8 billion.

If I ask if their number is greater than $p$, the chance that everyone
answers no is $p^N$, in which case the chance of saving the world is $1/N$.

The chance that $N \ge n > 0$ people answer yes is
${N\choose n}p^{N-n}(1-p)^n$, and the chance of saving the world is $1/n$.

So the overall chance of saving the world is

$$ S = p^N/N + (1-p)^N/N + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} {N\choose n}p^{N-n}(1-p)^n/n $$

$$ \frac{dS}{dp} = p^{N-1} - (1-p)^{N-1}} + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} {N\choose n}(\frac{(N-n)p^{N-n-1}(1-p)^n}{n} - p^{N-n}(1-p)^{n-1}) $$

$$ = p^{N-1} - (1-p)^{N-1} + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} {N\choose n}(p^{n-1}(1-p)^{N-n-1}((1-p)N/n-1) $$

I don't know how to evaluate this.  However, some numerical exploration
for smaller $N$ leads me to guess that $p = 1-\frac{3}{2N}$ maximizes the
chance of saving the world at a little more than 50%.
