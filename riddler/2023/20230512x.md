==========================
Starting with a $4\times4$ square, worth 42, removing an interior square
loses 8 points.  Removing an edge square loses 5 points.  Removing a
corner loses 3 points.

Adding a square next to an edge square adds 3 points, but then adding
to a square next to it could add 4 points.  So removing 2 adjacent
corners from a $4\times4$ square, then adding them next to edges on the
opposite side is worth 43 points.  Now, removing any square loses at
least 4 points.  (8 lose 4 points, 2 lose 5 points, 4 lose 7 points,
and 2 lose 8 points.)
