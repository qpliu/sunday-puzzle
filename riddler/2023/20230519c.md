==========================
If there are $n$ numbers in the hat with $d$ remaining draws, let the
expected winnings be $W(n,d)$.

The next draw has a $1/n$ chance of being $k \in \lbrace 1\ldots n\rbrace$.

Taking the money means winning $k + W(n,d-1)$, while adding the slips means
winning $W(n+k,d-1)$.

Drawing the greatest number every time and adding slips every time means
$2^99$ slips for the last draw, so a brute-force calculation is not
feasible.

For $d = 1$, always take the money,

$$ W(n,1) = \sum_{k=1}^n\frac{k}{n} = \frac{n+1}2 $$

For $d = 2$, taking the money means $k + \frac{n+1}2$, while adding slips
means $\frac{n+k+1}2$, which means always taking the money no matter what
is drawn,

$$ W(n,2) = n+1 $$

For $d = 3$, taking the money means $k + n + 1$, while add slips means
$n + k + 1$, which means taking the money and adding slips would result
in the same expected winnings no matter what is drawn,

$$ W(n,3) = \sum_{k=1}{n} \frac{n+k+1}{n} = \frac{3(n+1)}{2} $$

For $d = 4$, taking the money means $k + \frac{3(n+1)}{2}$, while
adding slips means $\frac{3(n+k+1)}{2}$, which means always adding
slips no matter what is drawn,

$$ W(n,4) = \sum_{k=1}{n} \frac{3(n+k+1)}{2n} = \frac{9(n+1)}{4} $$

It's clear that adding slips after all previous draws is the way to
maximize the winnings.

Postulate that $W(n,d) = A(d)(n+1)$, then

$$ W(n,d+1) = \sum_{k=1}{n} \frac{W(n+k,d)}{n} $$

$$ = \sum_{k=1}{n} \frac{A(d)(n+k+1)}{n} $$

$$ = A(d)n + \frac{A(d)(n+1)}{2} + A(d) $$

$$ = \frac{3A(d)(n+1)}{2} $$

giving

$$ A(d+1) = \frac{3A(d)}{2} $$

Since $A(2) = 1$, $A(d) = (3/2)^{d-2}$, so

$$ W(n,d) = (3/2)^{d-2}(n+1) $$

Plugging in $n = 1$ and $d = 100$ gives
$3^98/2^97 \approx 3.613 \times 10^{17}$.
