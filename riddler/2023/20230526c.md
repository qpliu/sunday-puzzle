==========================
An upper bound is 1/3, since up to 3 of the 9 stragglers will get a spot.

Let $P(n)$ be the probability that $n$ stragglers get a spot.

$$ P(0)+P(1)+P(2)+P(3) = 1 $$

The probability of getting a spot is $\frac{P(1) + 2P(2) + 3P(3)}{9}$.

The probability that no straggler gets a spot is the probability that
every early bird leaves after the last straggler drives by.  Or that
every straggler drives by before the first early bird leaves.

The probablility that one straggler gets a spot is the probability that
either 8 stragglers drive by before the first early bird leaves, which
must be before the last straggler drives by, or every straggler drives by
before the second early bird leaves and the first early bird must leave
before the second to last straggler drives by.

So it turns into a matter of how the 12 events, (3 leaving, 9 drive-by),
are ordered.  There are ${12\choose3} = 220$ ways, each equally probable.

Using [code](20230526c.hs),
there are 154 ways that result in 3 stragglers getting spots.

There are 54 ways that result in 2 stragglers getting spots.

There are 11 ways that result in 1 straggler getting a spot.

There is 1 way that results in no straggler getting a spot.

The probability of a straggler getting a spot is then

$$ \frac{154}{220}\cdot\frac39 + \frac{54}{220}\cdot\frac29 + \frac{11}{220}\cdot\frac19 = \frac{581}{1980} \approx 0.2934 $$
