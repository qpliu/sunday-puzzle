==========================
If Monty places the money randomly, then guessing the left or right door
would result in winning

$$ \frac{100}{3} + \frac{2}{3}\times(\frac{20}{2} - \frac{60}{2}) = 20 $$

and guessing the middle door would result in winning

$$ \frac{100}{3} + \frac{2\times 20}{3} = \frac{140}{3} $$

If I know that Monty never puts the money behind the middle door, then
guessing the left or right door would result in winning

$$ \frac{100}{2} + \frac{20}{2} = 60 $$

and guessing the middle door would result in winning 20.

If Monty places the money behind the middle door with chance $x$, and
with chance $\frac{1-x}{2}$, then guessing the middle door last would result
in winning

$$ \frac{100(1-x)}{2} + \frac{20(1-x)}{2} - 40x = 60 - 100x $$

and guessing the middle door second result in winning

$$ \frac{100(1-x)}{2} + 20x - \frac{40(1-x)}{2} = 30 - 50x $$

and guessing the middle door first would result in winning

$$ 100x + 20(1-x) = 20 + 80x $$

If $x < 2/9$, guessing the middle door last maximizes the winnings, and if
$x > 2/9$, guessing the middle door first maximizes the winnings, so I
think $x = 2/9$, making the average net earnings $340/9 \approx 37.78$.
