==========================
The first three horses have 50%, 25%, and 20% chances of winning, so there
is a 5% chance that one of the last two horses win.

Let $x$ and $y$ be the odds of the last two horses.

$$ \frac{100}{x+100} + \frac{100}{y+100} = \frac{1}{20} $$

So, for a given $x$,

$$ y = \frac{1900x + 390000}{x-1900} $$

Since $x > 1900$, the first possible $x$ is +2000, making $y$ +41900, which
is also valid, making +2000 the highest possible odds for one of the last
two horses, which is approximately a 4.762% chance of winning.
