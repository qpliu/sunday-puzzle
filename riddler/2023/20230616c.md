==========================
Since there are only 10000 numbers to consider, a
[brute force computation](20230616c.hs) of all the sequences is feasible.

The longest sequence starts with 6239 with 111 numbers.

There are 3 sequences with 110 numbers, starting with 3416, 4655, or 9251.

There are 8 sequences with 109 numbers, starting with 167, 886, 2651, 3544,
5810, 6690, 9511, or 9631.

I note that the second number in the longest sequence is 9251, so 6239 will
never repeat.  Many numbers will never repeat.  For example, since there
are 20 numbers
(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1000,2000,3000,4000,5000,6000,6245,7000,8000,9000)
that are followed by 0, there must be at least 19 numbers that can't
follow any number, and thus never repeat.

Most of the numbers in the longest sequence do not repeat.  Only the last
4 numbers, 4100, 8100, 6100, 2100, repeat.
