==========================
The number of coin flips to get three in a row is $1 + n_1$, where
$n_1$ is the average number of flips needed after a flip.  Let $n_2$
be the average number flips needed after two in a row.  Then

$$ n_1 = 1 + n_1/2 + n_2/2 $$

$$ n_2 = 1 + n_1/2 $$

Solving gives $n_1 = 6$, $n_2 = 4$, so it takes 7 flips on average to get
three in a row.

I'll assume the die is 6-sided.  So the number of  rolls is $n + 1$,
where $n$ is the average number of rolls after a roll.

$$ n = 1 + 5n/6 $$

Solving gives $n = 6$, so it takes 7 rolls on average to get two in a row.

Let $r_1$ be the chance that the die roller wins after one flip and $r_2$
be the chance that the die roller wins after two flips in a row.

$$ r_1 = 1/6 + 5/6\times(r_1/2+r_2/2) $$

$$ r_2 = 1/6\times 1/2 + 5/6\times r_1/2 $$

Solving gives $r_1 = 29/59$.

Let $f_1$ be the chance that the coin flipper wins after one flip and $f_2$
be the chance that the coin flipper wins after two flips in a row.

$$ f_1 = 5/6\times(f_1/2 + f_2/2) $$

$$ f_2 = 5/6\times(1/2 + f_1/2) $$

Solving gives $f_1 = 25/59$.

Let $t_1$ be the chance that there is a tie after one flip, and $t_2$ be
the chance that there is a tie after the two flips in a row.

$$ t_1 = 5/6\times(t_1/2 + t_2/2) $$

$$ t_2 = 1/6\times 1/2 + 5/6\times t_1/2 $$

Solving gives $t_1 = 5/59$.

It adds up, $r_1 + f_1 + t_1 = 1$.

So the die roller is more likely to win.
