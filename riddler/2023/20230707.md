==================
Let this be the strip, where `.` marks the point, and horizontal width
is 10 inches and the vertical width is 1 inch.
```
11112222
111..222
333..444
33334444
```

Adding the connected opposite sides, where area 9 is the opposite side of
area 1, area 8 is the opposite side of area 2, area 7 is the opposite side
of area 3, and area 6 is the opposite side of area 4,
```
.4449@@98@@8333.
4444999988883333
6666111122227777

2222777766661111
.2227@@76@@6111.

```

It looks like the furthest point, marked as `@` would be on the border
between area 6 and area 8 in the center of the strip, or on the border
between area 7 and area 9 in the center of the strip.  This would not a
unique point, but it would be two points.  The distance along the center
of the strip would be $5+x$, while the distance going over the edge
would be $\sqrt{1 + (5-x)^2}$.  When they are equal, $x = 1/20$, making
those two points $101/20 = 5.05$ inches away.  I'm not seeing how there
could a unique point that is further away.
