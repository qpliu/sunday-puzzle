==================
Let this be the strip, where `.` marks the point, and horizontal width
is 10 inches and the vertical width is 1 inch.
```
11112222
111..222
333..444
33334444
```

Adding the connected opposite sides, where area 9 is the opposite side of
area 1, area 8 is the opposite side of area 2, area 7 is the opposite side
of area 3, and area 6 is the opposite side of area 4,
```
.4449@@98@@8333.
4444999988883333
6666111122227777
6@@6111..2227@@7

8888333344449999
2222777766661111
.2227@@76@@6111.

```

It looks like the furthest point, marked as `@` would be on the border
between area 6 and area 8 in the center of the strip, or on the border
between area 7 and area 9 in the center of the strip.  This would not a
unique point, but it would be two points.

If the distance along the center of the strip is $5+x$, the distance going
over the edge would be $\sqrt{1 + (5-x)^2}$.  When they are equal,
$x = 1/20$, making those two points $101/20 = 5.05$ inches away.  I'm not
seeing how there could be a unique point that is further away.  (Update:
the farthest point is not unique.)

------------
There are $N$ kinds of twists for an $N$-gon that result in a "MÃ¶bius prism."

Label the twist $M$, where $M = 1$ connects a face to an adjacent face, and
$M = -1$ is equivalent to $M = N-1$ in that they connect the face to the other
adjacent face, so they're the same kind, but $M = -1$ has less twistiness.
Both $M = 1$ and $M = -1$ result in one face.

The number of faces when doing twist $M$ is the greatest common divisor
between $M$ and $N$.

Using [code](20230707.hs), the 840-gon prism would have
$195/14 \approx 13.93$ faces on on average, which is the greatest for
$1 \le N \le 1000$.
