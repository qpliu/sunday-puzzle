==================
One of the operations would be dividing by 1, which should be generated by
subtracting 1 from 2.  The addition should be done before the multiplication,
and should add the two smaller numbers.  That makes largest value
(3+4)×5÷(2-1) = 35.

Extra credit
------------
When there are 2 of each operation, division after dividing by 1 is
multiplication, and that would use up the 1 and the two divisions.

Two subtractions could essentially turn the 2 into a -2.

That leaves -2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, with four additions and three
multiplications, where the -2 needs to be added to the sum of two of the
numbers.  Doing the additions to make the four sums as close to each other
as possible gives 9×(8+5-2)×(7+3)×(6+4) = 9900.  In other words,
9×(8-(2-5))×(7+3)÷(1÷(6+4)) = 9900.
