==================
It's impossible to produce 2, so not every number can be made.  Resorting
to [code](20230728.hs), 144 numbers can be produced:

1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 15, 16, 19, 25, 28, 31, 33, 36, 39, 48, 51, 57, 60, 63, 64,
67, 73, 76, 79, 97, 100, 103, 112, 115, 121, 124, 127, 129, 132, 135, 144,
147, 153, 156, 159, 192, 195, 201, 204, 207, 225, 228, 231, 240, 243, 249,
252, 255, 256, 259, 265, 268, 271, 289, 292, 295, 304, 307, 313, 316, 319,

Extra credit
------------
234 numbers can be produced (my code does not produce 0, because g(0) = 0
leads to an infinite loop):

The probability of any given combination of $n$ rolls is $1/6^n$, and
the conditional probability of rolls adding up to 7 is
$279936/(70993 \cdot 6^n)$, so the expected number of rolls is
$\sum 279936n/(70993 \cdot 6^n)$, where the sum is over all the combinations
of rolls adding up to 7, and 70993/279936 is the overall probability of rolling
7.  (There are 63 combinations of rolls adding up to 7.)

Resorting to [code](20230728mtr.hs), the expected number of rolls
is $171835/70993 \approx 2.42$.
