==================
Let the top (or bottom) row and left (or right) column be canonical, so
that a canonical pattern has at least one raised dot in the top row and at
least one raised dot in the left column.  Any pattern without a raised dot
in the top row or without a raised dot in the left column would be a
translation.

Consider cells with $n$ columns and $m$ rows.  If the upper left dot is
raised, there are $2^{nm-1}$ canonical patterns.  If the upper left dot is
not raised, there are $2^{n-1}-1$ different ways for the top row to have
at least one raised dot, and $2^{m-1}-1$ different ways for the left column
to have at least one raised dot, and $2^{(n-1)(m-1)}$ patterns of dots not
on the top row or left column.  That makes

$$ 2^{nm-1} + (2^{m-1}-1)(2^{n-1}-1)2^{(n-1)(m-1)} $$

canonical patterns.

When $n = 2$ and $m = 3$, that's 44 canonical patterns.

Extra credit
------------
When $n = 4$ and $m = 6$, that's 15499264 canonical patterns.

Making the rounds
-----------------
To put 10 chocolates in a $4\times4$ grid such that each row and each column
has an even number of chocolates, put 7 of them so that 4 of them are in
the same row and 4 of them are in the same column, then put the remaining 3
such that each is in a different row and column.

There are 4 rows and 4 columns, so there are 16 ways to put the first 7, and,
given an arrangement of the first 7, there are 3! ways to arrange the last 3,
so there are 96 ways.
