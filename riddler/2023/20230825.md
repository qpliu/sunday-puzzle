==================
If I bet $x$ dollars on the first game, I will end up with $100+x$ or $200-2x$.

When they are equal, $x = 100/3$, making the guaranteed amount 400/3.

------------
There are ${12\choose4} = 495$ scenarios.

Once the Eagles have 8 wins or 4 losses, I can bet everything.  That is
guaranteed to happen for the 12th game, but it can happen as soon as the 5th
game.

If the Eagles lose the first 4 games and I have $x$ left, I'll end up with
$256x$, so I should bet on the Eagles winning for each of the first 4 games
as long as they keep losing.

If there are $n$ games left and the Eagles will win $n-1$ and lose 1,
I should bet that the Eagles win the next game, because if the Eagles
lose the next game, I'll win the remaining $n-1$ bets.  If I have $x$
and bet $y$ that the Eagles win the next game and the Eagles lose, I'll
end up with $2^{n-1}(x-y)$.  If the Eagles win, I'll be in the same
situation, but with one fewer games and more money.

If there are $n$ games left and the Eagles will win 1 and lose $n-1$, the
logic is the same, but with the bets reversed.

If there are 2 games left and the Eagles will win 1 and lose 1 and I
have $x$ left and I bet $y$, I will end up with either $2(x-y)$ or $2(x+y)$.
To maximize the guaranteed amount, $y=0$, and I end up with $2x$.

If there are 3 games left and the Eagles will win 2 and lose 1 and I
have $x$ left and I bet $y$ that the Eagles win, then, if the Eagles lose,
I will end up with $4(x-y)$, and if the Eagles win, I will end up
with $2(x+y)$.  To maximize the guaranteed amount, $y=x/3$,
and I end up with $8x/3$.

If there are 4 games left and the Eagles will win 3 and lose 1 and I
have $x$ left and I bet $y$ that the Eagles win, then, if the Eagles lose,
I will end up with $8(x-y)$, and if the Eagles win, I will end up with
$8(x+y)/3$.  To maximize the guaranteed amount, $y=x/2$, and I
end up with $4x$.

If there are 4 games left and the Eagles will win 2 and lose 2 and I
have $x$ left and I bet $y$, then, if I win the bet, I will end up with
$8(x+y)/3$, and if I lose the bet, I will end up with $8(x-y)/3$, so
$y=0$ and I end up with $8x/3$.

If there are 5 games left and the Eagles will win 4 and lose 1 and I
have $x$ left and I bet $y$ that the Eagles win, then, if the Eagles lose,
I will end up with $16(x-y)$, and if the Eagles win, I will end up
with $4(x+y)$, so $y=3x/5$ and I will be guaranteed $32x/5$.

If there are 5 games left and the Eagles will win 3 and lose 2 and I
have $x$ left and I bet $y$ that the Eagles will win, then, if the Eagles
lose, I will end up with $4(x-y)$, and if the Eagles win, I will end
up with $8(x+y)/3$, so $y=x/5$ and I will be guaranteed $16x/5$.

Continuing with [code](20230825.hs), if the Eagles will go 8-4 and I
have $x$ left, I will be guaranteed to end up with $4096x/495$, which
is 81920/99 or about 827.47 when $x=100$.
