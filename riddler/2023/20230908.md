==================
Let the side length of square be one, then the hook at $(0,h)$ is
connected to the hook at $(1-h,0)$, and its band is $y = h - \frac{hx}{1-h}$.

Considering the adjacent bands,
$\frac{dy}{dh} = 1 - \frac{x}{1-h} - \frac{hx}{(1-h)^2}$, so they
intersect the band at $x = (1-h)^2$, or $h = 1 - \sqrt{x}$.

That means the slope of the curve is
$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{h}{h-1} = 1 - 1/\sqrt{x}$.

Integrating, $y = 1 + x - 2\sqrt{x}$, or a parabola.

Extra credit
------------
Consider the lower left quadrant.  When $x = 1/2$, $y = 3/2 - \sqrt2$.

Integrating

$$ \int_{3/2-\sqrt2}^{1/2} (-1/2 - x + 2\sqrt{x})dx =
   - x/2 - x^2/2 + 4x^{3/2}/3 |_{3/2-\sqrt2}^{1/2} =
 5/2 - 5\sqrt{2}/3 - (2-4\sqrt{2}/3)\sqrt{3/2-\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.1094757 $$

Multiplying by 4 gives approximately 0.4379, or about 43.8%.

Making the rounds
-----------------
Exploring with code,

```haskell
import Data.List(nub,sort)

f :: Int -> Int
f n = 1000*(d-a)+100*(c-b)+10*(b-c)+a-d
  where
    [a,b,c,d] = sort [(n `div` 1000) `mod` 10, (n `div` 100) `mod` 10, (n `div` 10) `mod` 10, n `mod` 10]

g :: [Int] -> [Int]
g = nub . map f
```

It looks like there are 2 fixed points, 0 and 6174.

0, 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444, 5555, 6666, 7777, 8888, and 9999 end up at 0, every
other number ends up at 6174.
