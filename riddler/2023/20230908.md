==================
Let the side length of square be one, then the hook at $(0,h)$ is
connected to the hook at $(1-h,0)$, and its band is $y = h - \frac{hx}{1-h}$.

Adjacent bands have
$\frac{dy}{dh} = 1 - \frac{x}{1-h} - \frac{hx}{(1-h)^2}$,
which intersect the band at $x = (1-h)^2$, or $h = 1 - \sqrt{x}$.

That means the slope of the curve is
$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{h}{h-1} = 1 - 1/\sqrt{x}$.

Integrating, $y = 1 + x - 2\sqrt{x}$.

------------
Consider the lower left quadrant.  When $x = 1/2$, $y = 3/2 - \sqrt2$.

Integrating

$$ \int_{3/2-\sqrt2}^{1/2} (-1/2 - x + 2\sqrt{x})dx =
   x/2 - x^2/2 + 4x^{3/2}/3 |_{3/2-\sqrt2}^{1/2} \approx 0.1094757 $$

Multiplying by 4 gives approximately 0.4379, or about 43.8%.
