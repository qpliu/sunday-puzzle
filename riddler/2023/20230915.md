==================
First noting that the winning percentages being random and independent is
an unrealistic simplification if the teams are playing each other.

There are 10 teams in 2 divisions, so there are 10 choose 5, or 252 ways to
order the 10 winning percentages, only 1 of which has every ELE team ordered
ahead of every ELC team, making the probability 1/252.

Making the rounds
-----------------
The target distribution is

|sum|count|
|---|-----|
|2  |1    |
|3  |2    |
|4  |3    |
|5  |4    |
|6  |5    |
|7  |6    |
|8  |5    |
|9  |4    |
|10 |3    |
|11 |2    |
|12 |1    |

For a 1/36 chance at 2, either the first die has one 1 and the second die
has one 1, or the first die has zero 1s and one 2 and the second die has
one 0.

For a 1/36 chance at 12, either the first die has one 4 and the second die
has one 8, or the first die has zero 4s and one 3 and the second die has
one 9, or the first die has zero 4s and zero 3s and one 2 and the second
die has one 10.  The last is incompatible with the requirements for a 1/36
chance at 2.

Due to symmetry, consider that the first die has one 1, two 2s, two 3s, and
one 4.

Since the second die has one 1, that makes one 2, two 3s, two 4s, and one 5
for possible rolls.

And the second die has one 8, making one 12, two 11s, two 10s, and one 9
for possible rolls.

There cannot be any more 3s or 11s, so the second die has no 2 or 7.

There must be one more 4 and one more 10, so the second die must have one
3 and one 6, making one more 4, two more 5s, two more 6s, two more 7s,
two more 8s, two more 9s, and one more 10.

There needs to be one more 5, three more 6s, four more 7s, three more 8s,
and one more 9, which is the case when the last two faces on the second die
are 4 and 5.

The faces on the first die are 1 2 2 3 3 4, and the faces on the second die
are 1 3 4 5 6 8.
