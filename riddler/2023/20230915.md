==================
First noting that the winning percentages being random and independent is
an unrealistic simplification if the teams are playing each other.

There are 10 teams in 2 divisions, so there are 10 choose 5, or 252 ways to
order the 10 winning percentages, only 1 of which has every ELE team ordered
ahead of every ELC team, making the probability 1/252.
