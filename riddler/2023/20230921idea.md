Puzzle idea 2023-09-21
======================
Two weeks into the American football season, there are some undefeated
and some winless teams.  What are the odds?  There are 32 teams with each
team playing one game a week.  Assume that the outcome of each game is
random, with each team having an equal probability of winning.  There are
no ties, no byes, and, in week 2, no rematches.

After week 1, there are 16 1-0 teams and 16 0-1 teams.  After week 2, what
is the probability that there are no 2-0 teams?

Extra credit: After week 2 in the 2023 NFL season, there were 9 2-0 teams.
What's the probability that there are exactly 9 2-0 teams after week 2?

My solution
-----------
It's the probability that each 1-0 team is matched up against an 0-1 team
and loses.

If there are $n$ 1-0 teams and $n$ 0-1 teams, let the probability that
each 1-0 team is matched up against an 0-1 team be $P(n)$.

Take an arbitrary 1-0 team, team A.  Due to no rematches, the probability that
it matched up against an 0-1 team, team B, is $(n-1)/(2n-2)$.  That means
$P(n) = (n-1)Q(n-1)/(2n-2)$, where $Q(n-1)$ is the probability that the
each remaining 1-0 team is matched up with an 0-1 team.

To calculate $Q(n)$, take the 1-0 team that defeated team B in week 1, team C.
The probability that team C is matched up against the 0-1 team defeated by
team A in week 1, team Z, is $1/(2n-1)$.  The probability that team C is
matched up against some other 0-1 team is $(n-1)/(2n-1)$.  That makes

$$ Q(n) = P(n-1)/(2n-1) + (n-1)Q(n-1)/(2n-1) $$

where $Q(2) = 1/2$, because team C can't be matched up against team Z,
otherwise the last two teams would be a rematch, so its opponent is either
the last 1-0 team or the other 0-1 team.  Also, $Q(1) = 1$, matching the
last 1-0 team against team Z.

$$ P(16) = 5309738115403/75462501834720000 \approx 7.03626e-5 $$

The probability that the 0-1 team wins every game is $1/2^{16}$, making
the probability that there are no 2-0 teams

$$ 5309738115403/4945510520240209920000 \approx 1.07365e-9 $$

That's so improbable that it would take lots and lots of simulations to
resolve that.

I don't have any clever insights, so I'll calculate the probability of having
no 1-0 vs 1-0 matchups up to 8 1-0 vs 1-0 matchups, and then for each,
multiply by the probability that exactly 9 teams end up at 2-0.  Adding those
up gives the probability that there are exactly 9 2-0 teams.

If there are $n$ 1-0 vs 1-0 matchups, that will result in $n$ 2-0 teams.
There will also be $n$ 0-1 vs 0-1 matchups, resulting in no 2-0 teams,
and $16-2n$ 1-0 vs 0-1 matchups, each of which can result in one or zero
2-0 teams.  Let $P(n,m)$ be the probability of resulting in $m$ 2-0 teams.
If $m < n$, $P(n,m) = 0$.  If $m > 16-n$, $P(n,m) = 0$.  Otherwise,
$P(n,m) = {{16-2n}\choose{m-n}}/2^{16-2n}$.

If there are $k$ 1-0 teams and $l$ 0-1 teams, let $N(k,l,n)$ be the probability
that there are $n$ 1-0 vs 1-0 matchups.  The probability that there will
be $m$ 2-0 teams is

$$ \sum_{n=0}^{8} N(16,16,n)P(n,m) $$

Consider an arbitrary 1-0 team, team A, matched up against team B.  Excluding
the rematch, the probability that team B is 1-0 is $(k-1)/(k+l-2)$, and the
probability that team B is 0-1 is $(l-1)/(k+l-2)$, making

$$ N(k,l,n) = (k-1)K(k-2,l,n-1)/(k+l-2) + (l-1)L(k-1,l-1,n)/(k+l-2) $$

where $N(k,l,n) = 0$ when $2n > k$, and $N(1,1,n) = 0$ because that would be
a rematch, and $N(k,l,0) = 1$ when $k < 2$.

For $K(k,l,n)$, take the team that lost to team B in week 1, team C.
The probability that team C is matched up against the team that lost to
team A in week 1, team Z, is $1/(k+l-1)$.  The probability that team C is
matched up against some other 0-1 team is $(l-2)/(k+l-1)$, and the
probability that team C is matched up against a 1-0 team is $k/(k+l-1)$.

$$ K(k,l,n) = N(k,l-2,n)/(k+l-1) + (l-2)L(k,l-2,n)/(k+l-1) + kK(k-1,l-1,n)/(k+l-1) $$

where $K(k,l,n) = 0$ when $2n > k$ or when $n < 0$, and $K(k,l,0) = 1$
when $k < 2$.

For $L(k,l,n)$, take the team that beat team B in week 1, team C.
The probability that team C is matched up against team Z is $1/(k+l-1)$.
The probability that team C is matched up against some other 0-1 team
is $(l-1)/(k+l-1)$, and the probability that team C is matched up against
a 1-0 team is $(k-1)/(k+l-1)$.

$$ L(k,l,n) = N(k-1,l-1,n)/(k+l-1) + (l-1)L(k-1,l-1,n)/(k+l-1) + (k-1)K(k-2,l,n-1)/(k+l-1) $$

where $L(k,l,n) = 0$ when $2n > k$, and $K(k,l,0) = 1$ when $k < 2$.
Also, $L(2,2,0) = L(2,2,1) = 1/2$, because the opponent can't be team Z,
otherwise the last two teams would be a rematch, so the two possible
opponents are the other 1-0 team and the other 0-1 team.

Using code, assuming no errors in my reasoning or in my code (the
probabilities add up to 1 and probability of $m$ 2-0 teams is the same as
the probability of $16-m$ 2-0 teams, so those sanity checks pass),
