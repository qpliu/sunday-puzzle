==================
Let $F(0)$ be the number of flips on average to light all the lanes when no
lanes are lit.

$$ F(0) = 1 + F(1) $$

$$ F(1) = 1 + F(0)/4 + 3F(2)/4 $$

$$ F(2) = 1 + F(1)/2 + F(3)/2 $$

$$ F(3) = 1 + 3F(2)/4 + F(4)/4 $$

$$ F(4) = 0 $$

$$ F(2) = 1 + F(1)/2 + 1/2 + 3F(2)/8 $$

$$ F(2) = 12/5 + 4F(1)/5 $$

$$ F(1) = 1 + F(0)/4 + 9/5 + 3F(1)/5 $$

$$ F(1) = 7 + 5F(0)/8 $$

$$ F(0) = 8 + 5F(0)/8 $$

$$ F(0) = 64/3 \approx 21.3333 $$

$$ F(1) = 61/3 $$

$$ F(2) = 56/3 $$

$$ F(3) = 15 $$

It takes 21 1/3 flips on average to make all four lanes lit.
