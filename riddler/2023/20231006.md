==================
An upper bound is *1234500000* = 462120.  Then, to minimize, move digits to
the right of the 5.  The number to the right of the 5 must be a multiple
of the least common multiple of 1 through 5, or 60.  The number to the
right of the 5 cannot be more than 119, so it must be 60 = *22000*, so
the answer is *134522000* = 58980.
