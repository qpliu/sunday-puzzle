==================
An upper bound is *1234500000* = 462120.  Then, to minimize, move digits to
the right of the 5.  The number to the right of the 5 must be a multiple
of the least common multiple of 1 through 5, or 60.  The number to the
right of the 5 cannot be more than 119, so it must be 60 = *22000*, so
the answer is *134522000* = 58980.

Extra credit
------------
Starting with *123456789000000000* = 401839064968320.  Then, move digits
to the right of the 9.  The number to the right of the 9 must be a multiple
of the least common multiple of 1 through 9, or 2520.

Using [code](20231006.hs), finds 65 multiples of 2520: *0*,
*10000000* = 7! = 5040, ... *860000000* = 352800, *870000000* = 357840,
where the 7! digit has 8 possibilities when the 8! digit is 0 or 8 and
the 7! digit has 7 possibilities when the 8! digit is 1 through 7.

So the answer is *1234569870000000* = 1502852999760.

Further thoughts
----------------
Relaxing the requirement that each digit appears exactly once finds
144 numbers less than or equal to *123456789000000000*, the smallest of
which being *124569873300000* = 101773322280, since *3300000* = 2520.
