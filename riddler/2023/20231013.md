==================
There's must be some way to use combinatorics to get some expression
for the probability, since a [brute force calculation](20231013.hs) is
way too slow.

Consider a deck 4 jacks and 48 non-jacks.  The probability distribution
of the number jacks one player gets is the
[hypergeometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution).

The distribution is $p(k) = \frac{{K\choose k}{N-K\choose n-k}}{N\choose n}$,
where $K = 4$, $N = 52$, $n = 26$.
The probability that player A gets 4 or 0 jacks is 46/833, 3 or 1 jacks
is 208/833, and 2 jacks is 325/833.

If player A got 4 jacks, consider the queens.  $K = 4$, $N = 48$, $n = 22$.
The probability that player A gets 4 queens is 1463/38916, 3 queens is
2002/9729.

If player A got 3 jacks, consider the queens.  $K = 4$, $N = 48$, $n = 23$.
The probability that player A gets 4 queens is 77/1692, 3 queens is 385/1692.

If player A got 4 jacks and 4 queens, consider the kings.
$K = 4$, $N = 44$, $n = 18$.
The probability that player A gets 4 kings is 3060/135751, 3 kings is
21216/135751.

If player A got 4 jacks and 3 queens, or 3 jacks and 4 queens, consider the
kings.  $K = 4$, $N = 44$, $n = 19$.
The probability that player A gets 4 kings is 3876/135751, 3 kings is
24225/135751.

If player A got 3 jacks and 3 queens, consider the kings.
$K = 4$, $N = 44$, $n = 20$.
The probability that player A gets 4 kings is 4845/135751, 3 kings is
27360/135751.

So the probablilities for player A are
|J|-|Q|-|K|-|p|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|4|46/833  |4|77/1692   |4|3060/135751  |190/4060189|
|4|46/833  |4|77/1692   |3|21216/135751 |3952/12180567|
|4|46/833  |3|2002/9729 |4|3876/135751  |3952/12180567|
|4|46/833  |3|2002/9729 |3|24225/135751 |24700/12180567|
|3|208/833 |4|77/1692   |4|3876/135751  |3952/12180567|
|3|208/833 |4|77/1692   |3|24225/135751 |24700/12180567|
|3|208/833 |3|385/1692  |4|4845/135751  |24700/12180567|
|3|208/833 |3|385/1692  |3|27360/135751 |790400/69023213|

Adding them up gives 1280714/69023213, or approximately 1.855%.

Doubling it for either player A or player B, gives 2561428/69023213, or
approximately 3.711%.

Maybe aces also count as face cards, in which case the probability
is 1025978/150226993, or approximately 0.6830%.

Extra credit
------------
Missing rule: the player who collects all the cards wins, or maybe the
player who must play a card and has no cards loses.

Resorting to [simulation](20231013ec.go), it looks like I would win
about 3.9% of the time if my opponent plays first and wins every slap.

Making the rounds
-----------------
There are 32 possiblities for the first five flips.  30 of them will have
a flip following a heads.  2 of them will result in five more flips.  I'll
assume that the first flip of the next five flips does not count as
following a heads if the last flip of the first five flips is a heads.

* HHHHH - 4/4
* HHHHT - 3/4
* HHHTH - 2/3
* HHHTT - 2/3
* HHTHH - 2/3
* HHTHT - 1/3
* HHTTH - 1/2
* HHTTT - 1/2
* HTHHH - 2/3
* HTHHT - 1/3
* HTHTH - 0/2
* HTHTT - 0/2
* HTTHH - 1/2
* HTTHT - 0/2
* HTTTH - 0/1
* HTTTT - 0/1
* THHHH - 3/3
* THHHT - 2/3
* THHTH - 1/2
* THHTT - 1/2
* THTHH - 1/2
* THTHT - 0/2
* THTTH - 0/1
* THTTT - 0/1
* TTHHH - 2/2
* TTHHT - 1/2
* TTHTH - 0/1
* TTHTT - 0/1
* TTTHH - 1/1
* TTTHT - 0/1
* TTTTH - 0/0
* TTTTT - 0/0

Adding it up, 32/64 of flips following a heads is a heads, which is equal
to 0.5.  Maybe I'm missing something.  If the first flip of the next five
flips *does* count as following a heads if the last flip of the previous five
flips was a heads, then the fraction of flips following a heads that are
heads might be greater than 0.5.  If that was what was meant, I would have
thought the wording would have been "continue the experiment" instead of
"repeat the experiment".

The probability in that case would be

$$ p = \frac{31}{32}\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{32}(\frac{31}{32}\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{32}p) = 1/2 $$
