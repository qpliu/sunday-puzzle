==================
I'll assume uniform density.

If a corner is above sea level, the axis between two corners passing
through the center of the cube would be vertical, and the length of that
axis is $\sqrt3$ in a unit cube.

If the corner is $x$ above sea level, the volume of the pyramid above sea
level is $\frac{x^3\sqrt3}{5}$.  Setting that to $1/10$ gives
$x^3 = 1/\sqrt{12}$, or $x = 12^{-1/6} \approx 0.661$.

Since $y = \sqrt3 - x \approx 1.071$,

$$ \frac{x}{y} = \frac{12^{-1/6}}{3^{1/2} - 12^{-1/6}} = \frac{1}{324^{1/6} - 1} \approx 0.617 $$

The center of the cube is $\sqrt{3}/2 - 12^{-1/6} \approx 0.205$ below
sea level.

If an edge is above sea level, the length of the axis between the middle of
upper edge and the middle of the lower edge is $\sqrt2$ in unit cube.

If the top is $x$ above sea level, the volume above sea level is $x^2$,
which is $1/10$ when $x = 1/\sqrt{10} \approx 0.316$.

Since $y = \sqrt2 - x \approx 1.098$,

$$ \frac{x}{y} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{20} - 1} \approx 0.288 $$

The center of the cube is $\sqrt{2}/2 - 1/\sqrt{10} \approx 0.391$ below
sea level.

If a face is above sea level, then $x = 1/10$, $y = 9/10$, $x/y = 1/9$
and the center of the cube is $2/5$ below sea level.

So, in the "optimal" orientation, $x/y = 1/9$.

Allowing for non-uniform density, if 10% of the mass were concentrated at
one corner, and 90% of the mass were concentrated at the opposite corner,
the center of mass would be $9\sqrt{3}/10 \approx 1.559$ below sea level
and $x/y = 0$.

Extra credit
------------
For a sphere with radius 1, let $r$ be the radius the circular section of
the sphere $x$ below the top of the sphere.

$$ r^2 = 1 - (1 - x)^2 = 2x - x^2 $$

Integrating gives the volume of the portion of the sphere above sea level
$\pi(x^2 - x^3/3)$.  Setting that to $4\pi/30$,

$$ x^2 - x^3/3 = 2/15 $$

That gives $x \approx 0.3916$, so $y \approx 1.6084$ and $x/y \approx 0.243$.

Making the rounds
-----------------
The angles of vertices of a 25-gon add up to $25\pi - 2\pi = 23\pi$.
So the blue area is $\frac{23}{50}25\pi r^2$ and the orange area is
$\frac{27}{50}25 \pi r^2$, and the difference is $2\pi r^2$.
