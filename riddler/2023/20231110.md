==================
My guess is that two quadrilaterals that combine into a regular hexagon
maximizes their area at $3\sqrt{3}/2$.

Extra credit
------------
It's basically two triangles, and we want to maximize the area of one
of the triangles plus twice the area of the second triangle, so it makes
sense to first maximize area of the second triangle.

Maximizing the area of the second triangle means it's an equilateral
triangle with area $3\sqrt{3}/4$.

Subsequently, maximizing the area of the first triangle means it's an
isosceles triangle with area $\sqrt{3}/4$, so the sum is
$7\sqrt{3}/4 \approx 3.031$.

Making the rounds
-----------------
If the one who does not know which is the magic symbol knows which words
I don't select, then I'll not select blue or rectangular.  Otherwise, I
don't see how that one word without this context can communicate enough.

Of course, there is a single word that doesn't need that context: middle.
