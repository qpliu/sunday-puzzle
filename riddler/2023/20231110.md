==================
My guess is that two quadrilaterals that combine into a regular hexagon
maximizes their area at $3\sqrt{3}/2$.

Extra credit
------------
It's basically two triangles, and we want to maximize the area of one
of the triangles plus twice the area of the second triangle, so it makes
sense to first maximize area of the second triangle.

Maximizing the area of the second triangle means it's an equilateral
triangle with area $3\sqrt{3}/4$.

Subsequently, maximizing the area of the first triangle means it's an
isosceles triangle with area $\sqrt{3}/4$, so the sum is
$7\sqrt{3}/4 \approx 3.031$.

However, that's not correct.

Given a chord, maximizing the areas of the two inscribed triangles that have
that chord as an edge defines the the two other points.  Let $x$ be the
distance from the center of the chord to the center of the circle.  Then, the
areas of the triangles are $(1+x)\sqrt{1-x^2}$ and $(1-x)\sqrt{1-x^2}$ and
$Z$ is twice the area of the bigger triangle plus the area of the smaller
triangle,

$$ Z = (3+x)\sqrt{1-x^2} $$

which is maximized at $x = \frac{-3+\sqrt{17}}{4}$, which means

$$ Z = \frac{(9+\sqrt{17})\sqrt{-10+6\sqrt{17}}}{16} = \sqrt{\frac{107+51\sqrt{17}}{32}} \approx 3.1488 $$

Making the rounds

If the one who does not know which is the magic symbol knows which words
I don't select, then I'll not select blue or rectangular.  Otherwise, I
don't see how that one word without this context can communicate enough.

Of course, there is a single word that doesn't need that context: middle.
