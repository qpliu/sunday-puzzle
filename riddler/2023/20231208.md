==================
Making a tree of the probabilities leading to "One away..."
* 2nd in same set as 1st is 3/15
  * 3rd in same set as 1st 2 is 2/14, total 3⋅2/(15⋅14)
    * 4th in different set is 12/13, total is 3⋅2⋅12/(15⋅14⋅13)
  * 3rd in different set is 12/14, total 3⋅12/(15⋅14)
    * 4th in same set as 1st 2 is 2/13, total 3⋅12⋅2/(15⋅14⋅13)
* 2nd in different set is 12/15
  * 3rd in same set as 1st or 2nd is 6/14, total 12⋅6/(15⋅14)
    * 4th in same set as 3rd is 2/13, total 12⋅6⋅2/(15⋅14⋅13)

Adding them up gives 48/455, or about 10.55%.
