Making a tree of the probabilities leading to "One away..."
* 2nd in same set as 1st is 3/15
  * 3rd in same set as 1st 2 is 2/14, total 3⋅2/(15⋅14)
    * 4th in different set is 12/13, total is 3⋅2⋅12/(15⋅14⋅13)
  * 3rd in different set is 12/14, total 3⋅12/(15⋅14)
    * 4th in same set as 1st 2 is 2/13, total 3⋅12⋅2/(15⋅14⋅13)
* 2nd in different set is 12/15
  * 3rd in same set as 1st or 2nd is 6/14, total 12⋅6/(15⋅14)
    * 4th in same set as 3rd is 2/13, total 12⋅6⋅2/(15⋅14⋅13)

Adding them up gives 48/455, or about 10.55%.

Making the rounds
-----------------
Let the radius of the larger circle be 1.

The radius of the of the smaller circle is 1/√2.

The area of the triangle is 1/2.

The area of quarter of the larger circle is 𝜋/4, so the middle
area is 𝜋/4-1/2.

The area of half of the smaller circle 𝜋/4, so the area of the
crescent is 1/2.

So the ratio is 1.
