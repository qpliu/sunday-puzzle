==================
[Simulating](20231215.go) gives Kyle an approximately 64.2% probability of
winning.

From the start of the game, there's a 7/64 probability that Kyle wins,
and a 7/64 probability that Kyle loses and 50 other equally probable states
from which to continue the game.

That sets up a system of 50 linear equations.

[Solving](20231215.hs) gives the probability of winning from each state.
Adding them up, dividing by 64, and adding 7/64 gives 45667/71106, which is
approximately 64.224%.

|HHT HTT THH TTH | 7202819983/12981609102 | 55.5% |
|HTH THT | 36901193/74330850 | 49.6% |

and HTH and THT give the closest to even odds at 36901193/74330850, or about
49.6%.
