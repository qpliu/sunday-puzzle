==================
[Simulating](20231215.go) gives Kyle an approximately 64.2% probability of
winning.

From the start of the game, there's a 7/64 probability that Kyle wins,
and a 7/64 probability that Kyle loses and 50 other equally probable states
from which to continue the game.

That sets up a system of 50 linear equations.

[Solving](20231215.hs) gives the probability of winning from each state.
Adding them up, dividing by 64, and adding 7/64 gives 45667/71106, which is
approximately 64.224%.

|HTH THT | 36901193/74330850 | 49.6% |

and HTH and THT give the closest to even odds at 36901193/74330850, or about
49.6%.

Making the rounds
-----------------
The triangles will have sides of length 1/√5 and 2/√5 and a hypotenuse of
length 1, so the left edge must be a hypotenuse and the top edge must be
two.

The two non-right vertices cannot be split, so that determines the triangles
with those, splitting the right angle.

The remainder of the right angle and the remaining 1 from the side of
length 2 determines a third triangle, leaving a rectangle with sides
of length 1/√5 and 2/√5, which can be bisected in two ways to make the
last two triangles.
