==================
[Numerically](20231222.hs) found 41 triples $(l,m,n)$ such that
$l^2 + m^2 + n^2 = 2024^2$ where $l \le m \le n$ are positive integers,
and the greatest volume is 1104×1104×1288 = 1569835008.

Extra credit
------------
Some [computation exploration](20231222.hs) turns up
399,1198,599,1798,899,2698,1349,4048,2024.

399 is a multiple of 3, so it cannot come from a smaller number, so all
preceding numbers are 399 multipled by powers of 2.

Computationally verified that all positive integers less than 399
reach 1 without reaching 2024.

This could have been easily done computationally with a brute force
search.

Making the rounds
-----------------
Let $a = 1-d/2$, the distance between the center of the diameter and
the right edge of the square.

Then, the right triangle formed by the upper left intersection of the
semicircle and the square, the lower left intersection of semicircle and the
square, and the lower right corner of the square has sides with lengths
1, $2a$, and $d$, so $d^2 = 1 + 4a^2 = 1 + 4 - 4d + d^2$.

So $d = 5/4$.
