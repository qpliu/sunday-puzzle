==================
[Numerically](20231222.hs) found 41 triples $(l,m,n)$ such that
$l^2 + m^2 + n^2 = 2024^2$ where $l \le m \le n$ are positive integers,
and the greatest volume is 1104×1104×1288 = 1569835008.

Extra credit
------------
Some [computation exploration](20231222.hs) turns up
399,1198,599,1798,899,2698,1349,4048,2024.

399 is a multiple of 3, so it cannot come from a smaller number, so all
preceding numbers are 399 multipled by powers of 2.

Computationally verified that all positive integers less than 399
reach 1 without reaching 2024.

This could have been easily done computationally with a brute force
search.
