==================
Given three points, if there is a triangle with three points on one edge,
the smallest largest triangle will have area of 1, which is when the three
points are on a diameter.  I hypothesize that the smallest largest triangle
is smaller than 1.

If the three points form a triangle not containing the center, a triangle
containing the center can be made with area of at least 1.

So the three points will make a largest triangle with either two points on
one edge and one on another, or with one point on each edge.

Let the middle point be $y$ from the center, and let the red chord passing
through the two points be $h$ from the center.

Let $r$ be the distance of the top two green sides from the center.

Then, the area of the yellow triangle is $(1-r)\sqrt{1-r^2}$, and
$x = \frac{r(y+h)}{\sqrt{y^2-r^2}}$ is half the distance between
the two points on the red chord.

The red chord cannot be closer to the center than $r$, otherwise the
isosceles triangle with the red chord as one side will be larger than
the yellow triangle, so $h \ge r$.

The two lower points cannot be further from the center than the middle point,
otherwise the red triangle will not be larger than the inner triangles
with a chord through the middle point and a lower point as an edge, so
$y^2 \ge x^2 + h^2$.

The area of the red triangle is
$(y_0+h)\sqrt{1-h^2}$, where $x_0^2 + y_0^2 = 1$ and
$y_0 - y = x_0 \frac{y+h}{\sqrt{1-h^2}}$.

The area of the black triangle is $4x(h+y)$ as long as $y+2h \le 1$
and $4x^2 + y^2 \le 1$.

The area of the green triangle is
is $x_1(y+y_1)$ where $x_1^2 + y_1^2 = 1$ and $y_1 + y = x_1(y+h)/x$,
so the area is $x_1^2(y+h)/x$.

$$ y_0^2(1 + (1-h^2)/(y+h)^2) - 2yy_0(1-h^2)/(y+h)^2 + y^2(1-h^2)/(y+h)^2 = 1 $$
$$ y_0^2((y+h)^2 + (1-h^2)) - 2y(1-h^2)y_0 + y^2(1-h^2) - (y+h)^2 = 0 $$

$$ x_1^2(1 + (y+h)^2/x^2) - 2y(y+h)x_1/x + y^2 = 1 $$
$$ x_1^2(x^2 + (y+h)^2) - 2xy(y+h)x_1 + x^2(y^2-1) = 0 $$

Evaluating [numerically](20240105.hs),
when $r = h = y/2$, which is when the points make an equilateral triangle,
the yellow and red triangles have equal areas of approximately 0.82864
when $r \approx 0.16048$.

The black and green triangles are smaller, and the only way I see to
make them larger while making the yellow and red triangles smaller is
to move the top point closer to the center than the other two points.
