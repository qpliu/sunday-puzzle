==================
Given three points, if there is a triangle with three points on one edge,
the smallest largest triangle will have area of 1, which is when the three
points are on a diameter.  I hypothesize that the smallest largest triangle
is smaller than 1.

If the three points form a triangle not containing the center, a triangle
containing the center can be made with area of at least 1.

So the three points will make a largest triangle with either two points on
one edge and one on another, or with one point on each edge.

Consider a chord, the blue chord in the figure, on which two of the points
lie, and a third point.  If the chord is $r$ from the center, the isosceles
triangle, the light green triangle in the figure, has area
$(1-r)\sqrt{1-r^2}$, so the third point must restrict the triangles on the
other side of the chord to that area or smaller.

Also, the third point must be within the yellow triangle.

The red chords plus the blue chord form a triangle with the same area as
the light green triangle, so the third point must be on that triangle's
perimeter.  The third point must cannot be right of the center, otherwise
a larger triangle could be made.

So it makes sense to put the third point directly above the center.  Then,
choosing the two points on the blue chord, the three points must make a
triangle that includes the center.  Also, the three sides of the
triangle cannot be closer than $r$ to the center, otherwise a triangle
larger than the light green triangle could be made.  That means the three
points make an isosceles triangle.

Now, minimizing the area of the largest triangle means maximizing $r$.
The limit on $r$ is the black triangle with one point on each edge, which
will have the same area as the light green triangle at the minimum.

The upper vertex of the red triangle is $1-r$ above the blue chord, so it
is $1-2r$ above the horizontal diameter, so it is $\sqrt{1-(1-2r)^2}$ to
the right of the vertical diameter.  Let
$x_0 = \sqrt{1-(1-2r)^2} = 2\sqrt{r-r^2}$ and $y_0 = 1-2r$.

Let $y$ be the distance between the third point and the center,
$y = \sqrt{1-r^2}\frac{y_0+r}{\sqrt{1-r^2}+x_0} - r$.

Let $x$ be half the distance between the two points on the blue chord.
Then, $\frac{x^2}{x^2+(y+r)^2} = \frac{r^2}{y^2}$, so that the edges of
the triangle formed by the three points are $r$ away from the center.
$x = \frac{ry+r^2}{\sqrt{y^2-r^2}}$.

The area of the triangle formed by the three points is $x(y+r)$, so the
area of the black triangle is $4x(y+r)$.

The smallest largest triangle then has area $4x(y+r) = (1-r)\sqrt{1-r^2}$.

[Numerically](20240105.hs) solving gives $r \approx 0.186317, for an
area of approximately 0.7994.
