==================
The probability of both picking dice with the same number of sides is 1/36.

The probability of them picking each of the 15 different dice combinations
is 1/18.

In either case, the probability of rolling the same is $1/n$, where $n$ is
larger number of faces of the two dice.

Using [code](20240112.hs) to add up the probabilities, the probability that
both are the same is 3/32.  [Simulations](20240112.go) agree.

Extra credit
------------
Using code, the expected number of distinct rolls is 8489153/3110400, which
agrees with simulations.

Making the rounds
-----------------
Consider 5 points.  The 3 red points and a blue point form a tetrahedron.
And the other blue point also forms a tetrahedron with the 3 red points on
the opposite side of the plane defined by the 3 red points.

A dividing plane cannot intersect the triangle formed by the 3 red points,
but must cut through the tetrahedron formed by the 3 red points and a blue
point, which necessarily divides the blue point from the other blue point,
so it is not always possible to find a dividing plane.

The remaining blue point could be anywhere that isn't on a plane with 3 other
points and is otherwise irrelevant.
