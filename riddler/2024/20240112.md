==================
The probability of both picking dice with the same number of sides is 1/36.

The probability of them picking each of the 15 different dice combinations
is 1/18.

In either case, the probability of rolling the same is $1/n$, where $n$ is
larger number of faces of the two dice.

Using [code](20240112.hs) to add up the probabilities, the probability that
both are the same is 3/32.  [Simulations](20240112.go) agree.

Using code, the expected number of distinct rolls is 8489153/3110400, which
agrees with simulations.
