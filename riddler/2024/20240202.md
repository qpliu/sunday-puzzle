==================
The smallest number for which $f(N) = 2$ is 19, so the smallest number for
which $f(N) = 3$ would have digits that add up to 19, which is 199.

So the smallest number for which $f(N) = 4$ would have digits that add up
to 199, which is 19999999999999999999999, or 2⋅10²²-1.

The smallest number for which $f(N) = 5$ is 2⋅10²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²-1.

Brute force [code](20240202.hs) counts 945 numbers between 1 and 10000 for
which $f(N) = 3$.

Making the rounds
-----------------
Given $M$ balls, for a given $N$, the probability of taking a red ball is
$N/M$.  The probability that the next ball is red is $(N-1)/(M-1)$ and the
probability that the next ball is green is $(M-N)/(M-1)$.

So the probability that the first ball is red is
$\sum_{N=0}^{M} \frac{N}{M(M+1)}$,
and the probability that both balls are red is
$\sum_{N=0}^{M} \frac{N(N-1)}{M(M+1)(M-1)}$.

And the probability that both balls are red, given that first ball is red
is

$$
\begin{aligned}
   p &= \frac{\sum_{N=0}^{M} \frac{N(N-1)}{M(M+1)(M-1)}}{\sum_{N=0}^{M} \frac{N}{M(M+1)}} \\
     &= \frac{\sum_{N=0}^{M} N^2-N}{(M-1)\sum_{N=0}^{M} N} \\
     &= \frac{M(M+1)(2M+1)}{6}\frac{2}{M(M+1)(M-1)} - \frac{1}{M-1} \\
     &= \frac{(2M+1)}{3(M-1)} - \frac{1}{M-1} \\
     &= \frac{(2M-2)}{3(M-1)} \\
     &= 2/3
\end{aligned}
$$

So the probability that the next ball is red is 2/3 and the probability that
the next ball is green is 1/3.

The counterintuitive result seems to be due to the first ball being red skewing
the distribution of $N$ from being uniform to making large $N$ more probable.
