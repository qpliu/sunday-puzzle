==================
Consider cases with smaller maximum numbers.

When only card is 1, the only sequence is 1.

When the cards are 1 through 2, the sequences are 121 and 212.

When the cards are 1 through 3, the sequences are 121, 131, 1323132, 212,
2313231, 232, 3132313, 3231323, so the longest sequences have length 7.

So, when the cards are 1 through 4, the longest sequences will have lengths
of at least 7.

Using [code](20240216.hs), there are 98 sequences, and 143424341 is the
longest with length 9.

Extra credit
------------
When the cards are 1 through 5, there 1508 sequences, and 111 of them are
the longest with length 15.

When the cards are 1 through 6, there are 81151 sequences, and 5 of them
are the longest with length 21.  The sequences are 354643546562656135616,
564626456535654626465, 616531656265645346453, 634626463656364626436,
and 635616563646365616536.

When the cards are 1 through 7, there are 3188153 sequences, and 22 of them
are the longest with length 31.  The sequences are

Making the rounds
-----------------
Since the corner of the big square is at the center of the small square,
the overlap area must be a quarter of the area of the small square, or
36, so the area of the large square must be 400 and x must be 20.
