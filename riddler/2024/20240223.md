==================
The chance of winning is $D_7/3 + D_3/3 + D_0/3$, where
$D_7 = 2/3 + W/3$, $D_3 = 1/3 + W/3$, $D_0 = W/3$, $W = 2/3 + (1-W)/3$.

Substituting, $W = 3/4$, $D_7 = 11/12$, $D_3 = 7/12$, $D_0 = 1/4$,
making the chance of winning 7/12.

Extra credit
------------
If we choose the field goal option and our opponent chooses the field
goal option when down a field goal, our chance of winning is
$D_7/3 + D_3/3 + D_0/3$, where $D_7 = 1/2 + W/2$, $D_3 = 1/3 + W/3$,
$D_0 = W/3$, $W = 2/3 + (1-W)/3$, giving $W = 3/4$, $D_7 = 7/8$,
$D_3 = 7/12$, $D_0 = 1/4$, making the chance of winning 41/72.

If we choose the field goal option and our opponent chooses the touchdown
option when down a field goal, our chance of winning is
$D_7/3 + D_3/3 + D_0/3$, where $D_7 = 1/2 + W/2$, $D_3 = 1/2$,
$D_0 = W/3$, $W = 2/3 + (1-W)/3$, giving $W = 3/4$, $D_7 = 7/8$,
$D_3 = 3/8$, $D_0 = 1/4$, making the chance of winning 13/24 < 41/72,
so our opponent will choose the touchdown option when down a field goal.

If we choose the touchdown option, our chance of winning is
$D_7/2 + D_0/2$, where $D_7 = 1/2 + W/2$, $D_0 = W/3$, $W = 2/3 - (1-W)/3$,
giving $W = 3/4$, $D_7 = 7/8$, $D_0 = 1/4, making the chance of winning
9/16 > 13/24, so the answer is 9/16.

Making the rounds
-----------------
If R≥5, then E=9, otherwise E=0.

If E=9, then L=4.  If E=0, then L=5.

If L=4, then D≤4 and C and U are even.  If L=5, then D≥5 and C and U are odd.

After some playing around, 4188504+2188504=6377008.
