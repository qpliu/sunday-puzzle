==================
I think I need a full tank at 1/4 of the way around.

Two cars can give me 1/3 of a tank at 1/4 of the way around by having
them going 1/6 of the way, transferring 1/3 of tank from one to another.
One returns using its remaining 1/3 of a tank.  The other continues to
1/4 of the way around, transfers 1/3 of a tank to me, then returns using
its remaining 1/2 of a tank.

That means I need another 1/6 of a tank, which one of the cars can do
by going 1/12 of the way with a half a tank, transferring 1/6 of a tank
to me, then returning with its remaining 1/6 of a tank.

Then, doing the same things at 3/4 of the way around and 11/12 of the
way around means it could be done with 3 cars.

Extra credit
------------
I start off with a full tank.  Giving me 1/3 of a tank twice takes 4 full
tanks.  Giving me 1/6 of a tank twice takes 2 half tanks.  That's 6 full
tanks in total, or 120 gallons.

Further thoughts
----------------
Let $G$ be the time to fill a tank at the gas station, $T$ be the time to
transfer a tank from one car to another and $D$ be the time to drive half
the loop.  Assume that acceleration, braking, setting up to getting or giving
fuel, tearing down from getting or giving fuel take no time.

The minimum time to do the loop would be $G + T + 2D$.  It would take 7
cars to guarantee being able to do it in this time, particularly if
$G \gg T, D$, starting off by filling my car and 4 others to a full tank,
and 2 cars to a half tank.

More realistically, $D > T > G$.  Using 3 cars, here's a possible timeline:
