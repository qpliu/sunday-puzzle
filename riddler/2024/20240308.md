==================
I think I need a full tank at 1/4 of the way around.

Two cars can give me 1/3 of a tank at 1/4 of the way around by having
them going 1/6 of the way, transferring 1/3 of tank from one to another.
One returns using its remaining 1/3 of a tank.  The other continues to
1/4 of the way around, transfers 1/3 of a tank to me, then returns using
its remaining 1/2 of a tank.

That means I need another 1/6 of a tank, which one of the cars can do
by going 1/12 of the way with a half a tank, transferring 1/6 of a tank
to me, then returning with its remaining 1/6 of a tank.

Then, doing the same things at 3/4 of the way around and 11/12 of the
way around means it could be done with 3 cars.

Extra credit
------------
I start off with a full tank.  Giving me 1/3 of a tank twice takes 4 full
tanks.  Giving me 1/6 of a tank twice takes 2 half tanks.  That's 6 full
tanks in total, or 120 gallons.
