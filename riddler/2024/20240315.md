I'll assume the pizza is infinitely thin.

For a lower bound, the area that needs to be covered is 50√3 square inches.

For an upper bound, take a 10×10√3 or a 20×5√3, folded in half, for 100√3
square inches.

Align a 10 inch edge of a 10×5√3 rectangle along one edge of the triangle,
fully covering one side.  Folding along the remaining edges leaves an
isosceles triangle with sides 10/√3,  10/√3, and 10, with area 50√3 uncovered.

One way to cover the remaining area would be to extend the aligned edge by
5/√3, making the rectangle 10×20/√3, 200/√3 square inches.

Extending an edge adjacent to the aligned edge would lessen the amount the
aligned edge would need to be exended.

Extending an edge by 5 or both adjacent edges by 5/2 would make extending
the aligned edge unnecessary, making the rectangle 15×5√3 for 75√3 > 200/√3.

Extending one of the adjacent edges by 5/2 means extending the aligned edge
by 5/(2√3), making the rectangle (10+5/2)×(5√3+5/(2√3))
for 875/(126√3) > 200/√3.

Extending one of the adjacent edges by $x$ means extending the aligned edge
by $(5-x)/\sqrt3$, making the rectangle $(10+x)×(5\sqrt3+(5-x)/\sqrt3) = 50\sqrt3 + 50/\sqrt3 + 5x\sqrt3 + 5x/\sqrt3 - x^2/\sqrt3 = (200 + 20x - x^2)\sqrt3$,
which is minimized at $x = 0$ for $0 \le x \le 5$.

So I think the minimum rectangle is 10×20/√3, or 200/√3≈115.47 square inches,
but there could be ways of orienting a smaller rectangle differently that
would cover the pizza.

Since overlapping the slices by putting the crust sides together
is undoubtedly cheating, put the slices together to make a rhombus.

The total area that needs to be covered is 100√3 square inches.

Start with a 15×5√3 rectangle aligned along two of opposite edges of the
rhombus completely covering one side, then fold along the remaining edges of
the rhombus covering half of the opposite side.

Then, the aligned edges would have to be extended by 5/(2√3) to cover the
remaining area, which means a 15×10√3, or 150√3 square inches, which does
not take advantage of the folds only the remaining edges.

Extending the non-aligned edges by 5 inches each means extending the aligned
edges is unnecessary, meaning 25×5√3, or 125√3 square inches.

Extending the non-aligned edges by $x$ means the aligned edges need to be
extended by ((5-x)√3)/2, making the rectangle $(15+2x)×(10-x)\sqrt3 = (150+5x-2x^2)\sqrt3$
which is minimized at $x = 5$ for $0 \le x \le 5$.

So I think the minimum rectangle is 25×5√3, or 125√3≈216.51 square inches.
