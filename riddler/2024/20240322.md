==================
Every team in the top half of the bracket will have a 2, and, except for the
1-seed, will have a 2.  Every team in the bottom half will have a 1, and,
except for the 2-seeed, will have a 2.  Eliminate the 1 and 2.

1-16 - 8 4 2
8-9 - 1 4 2

3-14 - 6 2 1
6-11 - 3 2 1

7-12 - 2 3 1

The 11 and 14 seeds will have opponents 3·6·2·1 and 6·3·2·1, for the
toughest schedules at √6≈2.45.

To find the toughest schedules, it looks like, starting from the
finals, trace back the lower seed, then, from the semi-finals, trace
back the lower seed, and so on, round by round.

From the finals, trace back from the 2 seed.  From the semi-finals,
trace back from the the 3 seed.  From the quarter-finals, 6 seed.  From
the round of 16, the 11 seed.  From the round of 32, the 22 seed.  From the
round of 64, the 43 seed.  From the round of 128, the 86 seed, and so on.

Let $S(n)$ is the trace seed for the round of $2^n$, then
$S(n+1) = 2^{n+1} + 1 - S(n)$.

If the $S(n)$ is the trace seed for the round of $2^n$, then the seed of
their opponent in that round is $2^n+1-S(n)$ and the two toughest
schedules for the round of $2^{n+1}$ are their opponents, $2^{n+1}+1-S(n)$
and $2^{n+1}+1-2^n-1+S(n) = 2^{n+1}-2^n+S(n)$.

From [https://oeis.org/A005578], $S(n) = 1 + \text{floor}(2^{n+1}/3)$.

For large $n$, that makes the seeds of toughest schedules $2^{n+1}(1-1/3)$
and $2^{n+1}(1-1/2+1/3)$, making the fractions 2/3 and 5/6.

Calculating with [code](20240322.hs) agrees for $N$ up to 20.

Making the rounds
-----------------
Alice's maximum score is 99, while Bob's maximum score is 48.  If Alice
runs up the score a few times, then, the rest of the time, Bob's average
score would be higher, and, if the distribution the rest of the time isn't
something like Bob running up the score a few times and getting edged out
the rest of the time, Bob should be more likely to win.

Considering 3 flips, there are 8 possibilities, Alice wins 2, Bob wins 3,
plus 3 ties.
* HHH - Alice wins 2-0
* HHT - 1-1 tie
* HTH - Bob wins 1-0
* HTT - Bob wins 1-0
* THH - Alice wins 1-0
* THT - Bob wins 1-0
* TTH - 0-0 tie
* TTT - 0-0 tie

Considering 4 flips, there are 16 possibilities, Alice wins 4, Bob wins 6,
plus 6 ties.
* HHHH - Alice wins 3-0
* HHHT - Alice wins 2-1
* HHTH - 1-1 tie
* HHTT - 1-1 tie
* HTHH - 1-1 tie
* HTHT - Bob wins 2-0
* HTTH - Bob wins 1-0
* HTTT - Bob wins 1-0
* THHH - Alice wins 2-0
* THHT - 1-1 tie
* THTH - Bob wins 1-0
* THTT - Bob wins 1-0
* TTHH - Alice wins 1-0
* TTHT - Bob wins 1-0
* TTTH - 0-0 tie
* TTTT - 0-0 tie
