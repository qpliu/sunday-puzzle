==================
Two possible last steps are adding 3 to A containing 2, or removing 3 from
A containing 8.

Other possiblities would need B to contain 1 or 2.  If B contains 1, then A
could contain 4 or 7.  If B contains 2, then a could contain 3 or 6.  These
are not achievable, since every step must end with at least one of the
pitchers empty or full, so every step must begin with at least one of the
pitchers empty or full.

Working backwards from 5,0 ← 2,3 ← 2,0 ← 0,2 ← 10,2 ← 9,3 ← 9,0 ← 6,3 ← 6,0
← 3,3 ← 3,0 ← 0,3 ← 0,0.  That's 12 steps.

Working backwards from 5,3 ← 8,0 ← 8,3 ← 10,1 ← 0,1 ← 1,0 ← 1,3 ← 4,0 ← 4,3
← 7,0 ← 7,3 ← 10,0 ← 0,0.  That's also 12 steps.

And the maximum value of $f(N)$ is $f(50) = 190$.

Making the rounds
-----------------
The probability that the second card has the same color as the first is
25/51.  Then, probability that the third card also has the same color as
first two is 24/50, so the probability that all three cards have the same
color is 4/17, or about 23.5%.
