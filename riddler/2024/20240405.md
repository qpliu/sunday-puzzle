==================
Starting from one edge of a cluster, $S = 1 + S/2 = 2$.

There are 16 possibilities for a 4Ã—4 group of squares.  By symmetry, only
need to consider half of them:

```
OO  OX  XO  XX  OO  OX  XO  XX
OO  OO  OO  OO  OX  OX  OX  OX
```

2 have the left edge of one cluster in one lane.  1 has the left edge of
two clusters, each in one lane.   And 1 has the left edge of one cluster
in both lanes.  So a cluster has a 4/5 probability that its left edge is in
one lane, and a 1/5 probability that its left edge is in both lanes.

Starting with the left edge in one lane, $S_1 = 1 + S_1/4 + S_2/4$.

Starting with the left edge in both lanes, $S_2 = 2 + S_1/2 + S_2/4$.

Solving gives $S_1 = 20/7$, and $S_2 = 32/7$, $S = 4S_1/5 + S_2/5 = 16/5$.
