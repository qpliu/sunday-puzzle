==================
One ellipse must cover at least half of the circle.  The circle does not
necessarily need to be divided along a diameter, but I don't see how
anything else would allow a smaller ellipse.  A disjoint half of the circle
would certainly waste lots of ellipse area.  An ellipse with half the area
of the circle cut out of the circle would minimize the area needed to
cover one of the halves, but the other half would need the original circle
to be covered.

Consider a semicircle, $x^2 + y^2 \le 1$, where $y \ge 0$, covered by an
ellipse $x^2/a^2 + (y-h)^2/b^2 \le 1$, which has area $\pi ab$.

Considering $y = 0$, $1/a^2 + h^2/b^2 = 1$ to barely cover the cusps.

Considering $x = 0$, $(1-h)^2/b^2 = 1$ to barely cover the apex.

That makes $b = 1-h$, $a = (1-h)/\sqrt{1-2h}$, so the area of the ellipse
is $\pi(1-h)^2/\sqrt{1-2h}$.

Minimizing gives $h = 1/3$,
so the area is $\frac{4\pi\sqrt3}{9} \approx 0.77\pi$.
