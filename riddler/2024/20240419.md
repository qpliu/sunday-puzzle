==================
If there are $n$ cards in each deck and $2m$ unique previously drawn cards
the probability of losing on the next draw is $(n-m)/n^2$.

The probability of two cards that don't match each other or any of the
previously drawn cards is $(n-m)(n-m-1)/n^2$.

The probability that one of the cards matches a previously drawn card
is $2(n-m)m/n^2$.

The probability that both of the cards match a previously drawn card is
$m^2/n^2$.

So the probability of losing is

$$ P(n,m) = (n-m)/n^2
          + (n-m)(n-m-1)P(n-1,m+1)/n^2
	  + 2(n-m)mP(n-1,m)/n^2
	  + m^2P(n-1,m-1)/n^2
$$

Using [code](20240419.hs), $1 - P(52,0) = 193937806586896328746924473226467394949530139620339174273819171217/527177615496365219422618541545122659969212453861982208000000000000$, or about 36.8%.

[Simulating](20240419.go), the probability of winning is about 36.8%.

Consider dealing from $2N$ cards, with $N$ pairs, into a deck.

If there are $n$ cards with $p$ pairs dealt into the deck,
then there are $2N - n$ undealt cards and $n-2p$ unpaired cards in the
deck and among the undealt cards, so there would be $N - n + p$ undealt
pairs remaining.

The probability that the next card dealt would make a new pair in the
deck is $(n-2p)/(2N-n)$, so the probability that the next card does not
make a new pair is $(2N-2n+2p)/(2N-n)$.

The probability that the deck contains $p$ pairs after $n$ cards were
dealt is then
$D(N,n,p) = (2N-2(n-1)+2p)D(N,n-1,p)/(2N-(n-1)) + (n-1-2(p-1))D(N,n-1,p-1)/(2N-(n-1))$.

Numerically calculating the probability that there are a given number of
pairs in 52 out of 104 cards and tabulating:

And, after making the decks, if there are $p$ pairs in each deck, there
are $52-2p$ matchable cards in each deck.

If there are $n$ cards in each deck and $m$ of them are matchable,
the probability of losing on the next draw is $m/n^2$.

The probability that both cards are matchable and do not match is
$m(m-1)/n^2$.  There are then two fewer matchable cards in each deck.

The probability that one of the cards is matchable the other is not
is $2(n-m)m/n^2$.  There is then one fewer matchable card in each deck.

The probability that neither card is matchable is $(n-m)^2/n^2$.  The
number of matchable cards in each deck remains the same.

That makes the probability of losing

$$ P(n,m) = m/n^2
          + m(m-1)P(n-1,m-2)/n^2
          + 2(n-m)mP(n-1,m-1)/n^2
	  + (n-m)^2P(n-1,m)/n^2 $$

The probability of winning is then

$$ 1 - \sum_{p=0}^{26} D(52,52,p)P(52,52-2p) $$

and evaluating that with [code](20240419.hs) gives 335561727225862936774353972738829595013743745454800896090990716254443717947031552/555926557447585078813889409645210912590669690718980253197612210789777133544921875, or about 60.36%.

[Simulating](20240419.go), the probability of winning is about 60.3%.

Further thoughts
----------------
It would be a more difficult calculation if drawing two cards of the same
rank meant losing.  The probability of winning would certainly be much
smaller.

Each rank could be in one of 25 states: both decks have 4, one deck has
4, the other has 3, etc, all the way to both decks have none.

The state of the decks can be represented by 25 non-negative numbers,
the number ranks in each state, and they must add up to 13.

Initially, the state would be 13,0,0 ... 0, where there are 13 ranks for
which both decks have 4 cards.

If the first draw does not lose, the state would be 11,1,1,0,0 ... 0, where
there are 11 ranks for which both decks have 4 cards, and 1 rank for which
the first deck has 4 cards and the second deck has 3 cards, and 1 rank for
which the first deck has 3 cards and second deck has 4 cards.

When simulating, the probability of winning is about 1.62%.

An exact calculation seems too computationally intensive for a full deck.

Consider 2 suits and 2 ranks.

On the first draw, the probability of losing is 1/2.  Otherwise, the
first deck has a singleton in the first suit and a pair in the second
suit and the second deck has a pair in the first suit and a singleton
in the second suit.

On the second draw, the probability of losing is 4/9.  The probability
that each deck is left with a (different) pair is 1/9.  And the probability
that each deck is left with two singletons is 4/9.

If each deck contains a different pair, the probability of losing is 0.

If each deck contains two singletons, the probability of losing on the
third draw is 1/2, and, if it gets to the fourth draw, the probability
of losing is 0.

So the probability of losing is 1/2 + 1/2⋅4/9 + 1/2⋅4/9⋅1/2 = 5/6, so the
probability of winning is 1/6.
