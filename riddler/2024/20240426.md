==================
If player A's total is $a$, then player B spins once if $b > a$, where $b$
is player B's first spin, and spins twice if $b < a$.  The edge cases where
$b = a$ or other spins or sums of spins are equal are irrelevant for these
calculations.  The probability that B wins on the first spin is $1-a$.
Otherwise, B must spin at least $a-b$ and no more than $1-b$ to win
on the second spin, which has probability $1-a$.  So, given $a < 1$, the
probability that B wins is $1-a^2$.

If player A's first spin is $a_1$, the probability of losing without a
second spin is $1-a_1^2$.  When spinning twice, the probability of
immediately losing is $a_1$, otherwise, the second spin is $a_2 < 1-a_1$
and the probability of losing is then $1-(a_1+a_2)^2$.  So, given $a_1$,
the probability of losing after spinning twice is

$$ a_1 + (1-a_1)\int_0^{1-a_1} da_2 (1 - (a_1+a_2)^2)
 = a_1 + (1-a_1)^3(2+a_1)/3 $$

So player A should spin twice if the first spin is less than $x$, where
$1 - x^2 = x + (1-x)^3(2+x)/3$, or $x \approx 0.5913548$.  There
are four real roots to $x^4 - x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0$, and one
of the roots is between zero and one, which is the relevant root.

So the probability of losing is

$$ \int_0^x da (a + (1-a)^3(2+a)/3) + \int_x^1 da (1-a^2)
  = 2/3 - x/3 - x^2/3 + 2x^3/3 + x^4/12 - x^5/15 $$

which is minimized at approximately 49.6216% when $x \approx 0.5913548$,
so the probability of winning is approximately 50.3784%.  I did not expect
it to be greater than 50%.

Solving the quartic equation, a closed-form expression for $x$ is

$$ x = \frac{1}{4} + S - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{-4S^2 + \frac{51}{4} + \frac{9}{8S}} $$

where $S = \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{17 + 8\sqrt6\cos\left(\frac{\cos^{-1}(1/\sqrt{864})}{3}\right)} \approx 1.45946$.

Extra credit
------------
If player B's first spin is less than the greater of $a$ and $x$, where
$a$ is player A's result and $x \approx 0.5913548$, player B will make a
second spin.

If $a < x$, the probability that player B does not make a second spin is $1-x$.
What player C does is irrelevant, since player A loses.

The probability that player B's result is less than $a$ after two spins
is $\int_0^a db (a-b) = a^2-a^2/2 = a^2/2$, in which case the probability
that player C wins is $1-a^2$.

The probability that player B's result is greater than 1 is
$\int_0^a db b = a^2/2$, in which case the probability that player C wins
is $1-a^2$.

The probability that player B's result is between $a$ and 1 after two spins is
$\int_0^a db (1-a) + \int_a^x db (1-b) = -a^2/2 + x - x^2/2$.

The probability that player A loses when $a < x$ is then

$$ 1-x + a^2(1-a^2) + a^2/2 + x - x^2/2 = 1 - x^2/2 + a^2/2 - a^4 $$

If $a > x$, the probability that player B does not make a second spin is $1-a$.

The probability that player B's result is less than $a$ after two spins is
$a^2/2$.

The probability that player B's result is greater than 1 is
$\int_0^x db b = x^2/2$.

The probability that player B's result is between $a$ and 1 after two spins is
$\int_0^a db (1-a) = a(1-a)$.

The probability that player A loses when $a > x$ is then

$$ 1-a + (a^2/2+x^2/2)(1-a^2) + a-a^2 = 1+x^2/2 - (x^2+1)a^2/2 - a^4/2 $$

I'll conjecture that player A spins twice if the first spin $a < y$ for
some $y$ where $x < y < 1$.  The probability that player A loses is then

$$ \int_0^x da \left(a
                + \int_0^{x-a} da_2 (1-x^2/2 + (a+a_2)^2/2 - (a+a_2)^4)
                + \int_{x-a}^{1-a} da_2 (1+x^2/2 - (x^2+1)(a+a_2)^2/2 - (a+a_2)^4/2)
               \right)
   \int_x^y da \left(a
                + \int_{0}{1-a} da_2 (1+x^2/2 - (x^2+1)(a+a_2)^2/2 - (a+a_2)^4/2)
               \right)
   \int_y^1 da (1+x^2/2 - (x^2+1)a^2/2 - a^4/2)
$$

Evaluating with Wolfram Alpha gives
$$
x^6/24 - x^4/4 + (x^2 y^4)/24 + (x^2 y^3)/6 - (x^2 y^2)/4 - (x^2 y)/6 + x^2/3 + y^6/60 + y^5/10 + y^4/24 + y^3/6 - (4 y)/15 + 11/15
$$

which has a minimum of approximately 65.76% at $y \approx 0.6443$,
so the probability of winning is 34.24%.

Further thoughts
----------------
One possible variation is that each player can spin any number of times, and
the number is the sum of all the spins.
