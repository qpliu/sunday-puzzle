==================
It can be done in 3 heats.

The first head eliminates 7.  Call the top three 1a, 2a, and 3a.

The second heat has 2a and 9 new runners.  Call the top three 1b, 2b, and 3b.

If 2a finishes first, the third heat has 1a, 2a=1b, 3a, 2b and the remaining
6 runners.

If 2a finishes second, the third heat has 1a, 1b, 2a=2b, and the remaining
6 runners.

If 2a finishes third or worse, the third heat has 1a, 1b, 2b, 3b, and the
remaining 6 runners.

The first three in the third heat are the three fastest.

This is a sorting algorithm.  From [OEIS: A036604](https://oeis.org/A036604),
10 races are needed for 6 sprinters.

Making the rounds
-----------------
If the current sum is $s \le 1$, then the expected number of numbers chosen is

$$ N(s) = s + \int_s^1 dt\,(1+N(t)) = 1 + \int_s^1 dt\,N(t) $$

Taking the derivative with respect to $s$,

$$ \frac{dN}{ds} = -N(s) $$,

which is solved by $N = Ce^{-s}$, where

$$ Ce^{-s} = 1 + \int_s^1 dt\,Ce^{-t} = 1 - Ce^{-1} + Ce^{-s} $$

so $C = e$, $N(s) = e^{1-s}$, and $N(0) = e$.
