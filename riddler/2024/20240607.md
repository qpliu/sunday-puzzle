==================
There are 2⁵=32 possible games, so it's possible to brute-force it by hand.

Listing all the possible scores at some point and the opponent's chances of
winning,

|score|their chances|
|-----|-------------|
|0-0 | $1/2$ |
|1-0 | $({4\choose4}+{4\choose3})/2^4 = 5/16 < 3/4$ |
|0-1 | $({4\choose4}+{4\choose3}+{4\choose2})/2^4 = 11/16 < 3/4$ |
|2-0 | ${3\choose3}/2^3 = 1/8 < 3/4$ |
|1-1 | $1/2$ |
|0-2 | $({3\choose3}+{3\choose2}+{3\choose1}/2^3 = 7/8 > 3/4$ |
|3-0 | $0$ |
|2-1 | ${2\choose2}/2^2 = 1/4 < 3/4$ |
|1-2 | $({2\choose2}+{2\choose1})/2^2 = 3/4$ |
|0-3 | $1$ |
|4-0 | $0$ |
|3-1 | $0$ |
|2-2 | $1/2$ |
|1-3 | $1$ |
|0-4 | $1$ |

So if the score at some point in the game is 0-2 or 1-2, 0-3, 1-3, 0-4, the
opponent's chance of winning was 75% or higher.

There are 16 possible games in which the opponent's chances of winning was
75% or higher at some point, and we win 3 of them, so the probability that
we won is 3/16.

Extra credit
------------
There are 5151 possible scores before the final possession is complete,
which seems computationally feasible.

If the score is $x$ to $y$, there are $p-x-y$ remaining possessions, where
$p=101$, so there are $2^{p-x-y}$ ways for the game to end.  There are
$W = \sum_{n=(p+1)/2-x}^{p-x-y}{{p-x-y}\choose{n}}$ ways for us to win,
so our probability of winning at this point is $P = W/2^{p-x-y}$.

Let $N(x,y)$ be number of ways to get to this score where the opponent's
chances of winning is $t=9/10$ or higher now or at some earlier point.
If $P \le 1-t$, then $N(x,y) = {x+y\choose x}$.  Otherwise,
$N(x,y) = N(x-1,y) + N(x,y-1)$, where
$N(x,-1) = 0$ for all $x$ and $N(-1,y) = 0$ for all $y$.

Then, the total number of ways to play a game with the opponent's chances
of winning being $t$ or higher at some point is $\sum_{x=0}^{p} N(x,p-x)$,
and the number of those in which we win is $\sum_{x=(p+1)/2}^{p} N(x,p-x)$,

Using [code](20240607.hs), there are 1303940929380534277290406564216 games
(out of 2¹⁰¹) where the opponent's chances of winning was 90% or higher at
some point, and we win 100950946076334560732219489624 of them, 
so the probability that we won is
12618868259541820091527436203/162992616172566784661300820527, or approximately
7.74%.

Simulations
-----------
[Simulations](20240607.go) agree in both cases.

### Fiddler
Simulations give the probability that the opponent's chances of winning
was 75% or higher at some point at about 50.0%, agreeing with 16/32 = 50%,
and the probability that we win those games at about 18.7%, agreeing with
3/16 = 18.75%.

### Extra credit
Simulations give the probability that the opponent's chances of winning
was 90% or higher at some point at about 51.4%, agreeing with
1303940929380534277290406564216/2¹⁰¹ ≈ 51.4%, and the probability that
we win those games at about 7.72%, agreeing with 
12618868259541820091527436203/162992616172566784661300820527 ≈ 7.74%.

Further thoughts
----------------
It shouldn't be surprising that one team's chance of winning being 90% or
higher at some point in more than half the games.  Unless the game is decided
by the last possession, the winning team's chance of winning is 100% by the
last possession.  Even if the game is decided by the last possession, either
or both teams could have had a chance of winning at 90% or higher.  So,
counting the ways in which neither team ever has a 90% or higher chance of
winning gives 64362274586949844837182090240 games, or about 2.5% of the 2¹⁰¹
games.  That means there were
2×1303940929380534277290406564216 + 64362274586949844837182090240 - 2¹⁰¹ =
136942932891559596424588807920 games in which both teams had a 90% chance
of winning at some point, which is about 5.4% of the 2¹⁰¹ games.

Making the rounds
-----------------
I took more than 10 minutes, though without computer or calculator aid (other
than typing my reasoning into the computer).

There are 4 places that L8 can fit, each reducing the problem to an
8×8 grid with a different deleted tile, (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4),
call them 23, 24, 33, 34.

Then, there are 4 places that L7 can fit, reducing the problem to a
7×7 grid.  There are multiple ways to get to some of them.

* 34→23→12
* 34→23→13
* 34→23→22
* 34→23→23
* 34→24→13
* 34→24→14
* 34→24→23
* 34→24→24
* 34→33→22
* 34→33→23
* 34→33→32
* 34→33→33
* 34→34→23
* 34→34→24
* 34→34→33
* 34→34→34

Combining,
* 1 way  to 12
* 2 ways to 13
* 1 way  to 14
* 2 ways to 22
* 4 ways to 23
* 2 ways to 24
* 1 way  to 32
* 2 ways to 33
* 1 way  to 34

Once the deletion hits a side, there are only 2 ways to place the next L,
and once the deletion hits a corner, there is only 1 way to place the
remaining Ls.

For 6×6,
* 1×12 → 11,12
* 2×13 → 12,13
* 1×14 → 13,14
* 2×22 → 11,12,21,22
* 4×23 → 12,13,22,23
* 2×24 → 13,14,23,24
* 1×32 → 21,22,31,32
* 2×33 → 22,23,32,33
* 1×34 → 23,24,33,34

For 5×5,
* 3×11 → 11
* 9×12 → 11,12
* 9×13 → 12,13
* 3×14 → 13,14
* 3×21 → 11,21
* 9×22 → 11,12,21,22
* 9×23 → 12,13,22,23
* 3×24 → 13,14,23,24
* 1×31 → 21,31
* 3×32 → 21,22,31,32
* 3×33 → 22,23,32,33
* 1×34 → 23,24,33,34

For 4×4, 4 also hits a side,
* 24×11 → 11
* 36×12 → 11,12
* 24×13 → 12,13
*  6×14 → 13
* 16×21 → 11,21
* 25×22 → 11,12,21,22
* 16×23 → 12,13,22,23
*  4×24 → 13,23
*  4×31 → 21,31
*  6×32 → 21,22,31,32
*  4×33 → 22,23,32,33
*  1×34 → 23,33

For 3×3, 3 hits a side,
* 101×11 → 11
* 101×12 → 11,12
*  50×13 → 12
*  51×21 → 11,21
*  51×22 → 11,12,21,22
*  25×23 → 12,22
*  10×31 → 21
*  10×32 → 21,22
*   5×33 → 22

For 2×2, there is only one way place the L1, so the total number of tilings
is 101 + 2×101 + 50 + 2×51 + 4×51 + 2×25 + 10 + 2×10 + 5.

Eschewing the aid of a calculator,
* 101 + 202 + 50 + 102 + 204 + 50 + 10 + 20 + 5
* 303 + 152 + 254 + 35
* 455 + 289
* 744

Actually, I used the computer to highlight the configurations to help count
the ways, so I did have the aid of a computer.
