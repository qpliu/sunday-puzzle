==================
There are 2‚Åµ=32 possible games, so it's possible to brute-force it by hand.

Listing all the possible scores at some point and the opponent's chances of
winning,

|score|their chances|
|-----|-------------|
|0-0 | $1/2$ |
|1-0 | $({4\choose4}+{4\choose3})/2^4 = 5/16 < 3/4$ |
|0-1 | $({4\choose4}+{4\choose3}+{4\choose2})/2^4 = 11/16 < 3/4$ |
|2-0 | ${3\choose3}/2^3 = 1/8 < 3/4$ |
|1-1 | $1/2$ |
|0-2 | $({3\choose3}+{3\choose2}+{3/choose1}/2^3 = 7/8 > 3/4$ |
|3-0 | $0$ |
|2-1 | ${2\choose2}/2^2 = 1/4 < 3/4$ |
|1-2 | $({2\choose2}+{2\choose1})/2^2 = 3/4$ |
|0-3 | $1$ |
|4-0 | $0$ |
|3-1 | $0$ |
|2-2 | $1/2$ |
|1-3 | $1$ |
|0-4 | $1$ |

So if the score at some point in the game is 0-2 or 1-2, 0-3, 1-3, 0-4, the
opponent's chance of winning was 75% or higher.

There are 16 possible games in which the opponent's chances of winning was
75% or higher at some point, and we win 3 of them, so the probability that
we won is 3/16.

------------
There are 5151 possible scores before the final possession is complete,
which seems computationally feasible.

If the score is $x$ to $y$, there are $p-x-y$ remaining possessions, where
$p=101$, so there are $2^{p-x-y}$ ways for the game to end.  There are
$W = \sum_{n=(p+1)/2-x}{p-x-y}{{p-x-y}\choose{n}}$ ways for us to win,
so our probability of winning at this point is $P = W/2^{p-x-y}$.

Let $N(x,y)$ be number of ways to get to this score where the opponent's
chances of winning is $t=9/10$ or higher now or at some earlier point.
If $P \le 1-t$, then $N(x,y) = {x+y\choose x}$.  Otherwise,
$N(x,y) = N(x-1,y) + N(x,y-1)$, where
$N(x,-1) = 0$ for all $x$ and $N(-1,y) = 0$ for all $y$.

Then, the total number of ways to play a game with the opponent's chances
of winning being $t$ or higher at some point is $\sum_{x=0}{p} N(x,p-x)$,
and the number of those in which we win is $\sum_{x=(p+1)/2}{p} N(x,p-x)$,

Using [code](20240607.hs), there are 1303940929380534277290406564216 games
where the opponent's chances of winning was 90% or higher at some point,
and we won 100950946076334560732219489624 of them, 
so the probability that we won is
12618868259541820091527436203/162992616172566784661300820527, or approximately
7.74%.
