==================
There are four possible rectangles in the first step.  Since two of them are
rotations of the other two, need to only consider the two and multiply the
result by two.

Consider the second one first, since it is simpler.  There is one way to
fill the left and right.  There are two ways to fill the top, so there are
two ways to fill the bottom, so there are four ways to fill both.

For the top of first one, there are three ways to fill a second rectangle,

There are two ways to finish the first of those.  The second is finished,
so there is one way for that.  For the third, there are two ways to finish
the left, so there are four ways to finish both the left and right.

So, in total, there are seven ways to finish the top, so there are 49 ways
to finish the top and bottom.

That makes 53 ways.  With the rotations, thats 106 ways.

There are 5 first rectangles, and 2 of them are rotations of 2 others, and
the last is the square.

Consider the 5×5 square, since it is the simplest.  The left, right, top and
bottom are
```
   ┌┐
  ┌┼┼┐

```
and each can be finished in 2 ways:
```
   ┌┐
  ┌┤├┐

```
so they combine for 16 ways to finish after the 5×5 square.

Consider the 7×3 rectangle.  The left and right are 1×1 squares, so there is
only 1 way to finish them.  The top and bottom are
```
   ┌┐
  ┌┼┼┐
 ┌┼┼┼┼┐
┌┴┴┴┴┴┴┐
```
and there are 3 ways to fill the second rectangle:
```

The first is the same as with the 5×5 square, there are 2 ways to finish it.

There is 1 way to finish the second.

The left side of the third can be finished 2 ways:
```

```
so there are 4 ways to finish both the left and right.

That makes 7 ways to finish the top after the 7×3 rectangle.  Combining
with 7 ways to finish the bottom and 1 way to finish the left and right,
that makes 49 ways to finish after the 7×3 rectangle.

Consider the 9×1 rectangle.  The top and bottom are
```

There are 4 ways to fill the second rectangle:

The first is the same as the 7×3, with 7 ways to finish.

The second is the same as previous cases, with 1 way to finish the left
and right, and 2 ways to finish the top, for 2 ways to finish.

The third is the same as previous cases, with 2 ways to finish the left,
2 ways to finish the right, and 1 way to finish the top, for 4 ways to finish.

The left side of the fourth has 3 ways to fill the third rectangle,

```
The first and third have 2 ways to finish, the second has 1 way to finish,
making 5 ways to finish the left.  With 5 ways to finish the right makes
25 ways.

That makes 38 ways to finish the top.  With 38 ways to finish the bottom,
that makes 1444 ways to finish after the 9×1 rectangle.

Adding up, there are 16 ways from the 5×5, 49 ways from the 7×3 and from
the 3×7, 1444 ways from the 9×1 and from the 1×9 for a total of 3002 ways.

### General formula

In general, there is probably some recursive formula.

Let $T(N)$ be the number of ways a triangular array with height $N$ and base
length $2N-1$ can be filled.  We have $T(1) = 1$, $T(2) = 2$.

Let $H(N)$ be the number of ways a triangular array that is half of a square
cut diagonally with height $N$ and width $N$ and be filled.  We have
$H(1) = 1$, $H(2) = 2$.

Let $T(0) = 1$, $H(0) = 1$.

Then,

$$
\begin{aligned}
  T(0) &= 1 \\
  T(1) &= 1 \\
  T(2) &= H(0)^2T(1) + H(1)^2T(0) \\
  T(3) &= H(0)^2T(2) + H(1)^2T(1) + H(2)^2T(0) \\
  T(4) &= H(0)^2T(3) + H(1)^2T(2) + H(2)^2T(1) + H(3)^2T(0) \\
  T(N) &= \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} H(i)^2T(N-1-i) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $S(N)$ be the number of ways the square can be filled.  Then,

$$
\begin{aligned}
  S(1) &= 1 \\
  S(2) &= 2T(1)^2T(0)^2 \\
  S(3) &= 2T(2)^2T(0)^2 + T(1)^4 \\
  S(4) &= 2T(3)^2T(0)^2 + 2T(2)^2T(1)^2 \\
  S(5) &= 2T(4)^2T(0)^2 + 2T(3)^2T(1)^2 + T(2)^4 \\
  S(6) &= 2T(5)^2T(0)^2 + 2T(4)^2T(1)^2 + 2T(3)^2T(2)^2 \\
  S(7) &= 2T(6)^2T(0)^2 + 2T(5)^2T(1)^2 + 2T(4)^2T(2)^2 + T(3)^4 \\
  S(N) &= \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} T(i)^2T(N-1-i)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Going back to $H$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
  H(0) &= 1 \\
  H(1) &= 1 \\
  H(2) &= 2H(1)H(0) = 2 \\
  H(3) &= 2H(2)H(0) + H(1)^2 = 5 \\
  H(4) &= 2H(3)H(0) + 2H(2)H(1) = 14 \\
  H(5) &= 2H(4)H(0) + 2H(3)H(1) + H(2)^2 = 42 \\
  H(6) &= 2H(5)H(0) + 2H(4)H(1) + 2H(3)H(2) = 132 \\
  H(7) &= 2H(6)H(0) + 2H(5)H(1) + 2H(4)H(2) + H(3)^2 = 429 \\
  H(N) &= \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} H(i)H(N-1-i) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

So $H(N) = C(N)$ are the Catalan numbers.

I don't have a closed-form expression for $S(N)$, but, using
[code](20240621.hs) the first 20 are 1,2,9,106,3002,153432,11209105,

Making the rounds
-----------------
There are 5 odd digits.  For example, 807 815 823 831 839.  Once the last
digit hits 9, the next in the sequence must be even.  Is it possible to
make it longer by having the largest digit be 6 for a while, then change to 8
being the largest digit without 7 being the largest digit in between?  I
think not, unless the number is even.

The only way I can see to getting to a number ending with 7 with 8 being
the largest digit is from something like 798, which is even.
