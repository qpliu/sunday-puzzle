==================
First, lose every point in one set.  But, for the other sets, lose every point
in the games lost, but win the minimum in the games won, which means not
winning more than four points, since those extra points would push the
percentage of points won towards 50%, so the games won would be won 4-2, and
the games lost would be lost 0-4.

Consider whether a tiebreak is part of it.  Winning a tiebreak would have to
be 7-5.  A 6-4 set would be 24-24 in points.  A 7-6 set would be 31-41 in
points, so winning 7-6 would lose a greater percentage of points than 6-4.

So, the match would be 0-6 7-6 7-6, which would be 62-106 in points, or
losing 106 of the 168 points, about 63%.

------------
[Simulations](20240712.go) gives a probability of about 6.3%.

Let $M(p)$ be the probability of winning a match with a point differential of
$p$.  Based on the fiddler answer, the point differential should be
$-44 \le p \le 58$.  And the answer would be $2\sum_{p=-44}^{-1} M(p)$,
where the factor of 2 is because either player could be the winner.

Let $S(p)$ be the probability of winning a set with a point differential of
$p$.  The point differentials, based on the fiddler answer, should be
$-10 \le p \le 24$, so $S(p) = 0$ for $p < -10$ or $p > 24$.

Let $G(p)$ be the probability of winning a game with a point differential of
$p$.  Unless $2 \le p \le 4$, $G(p) = 0$.

Let $T(p)$ be the probability of winning a tiebreak with a point
differential of $p$.  Unless $2 \le p \le 7$, $T(p) = 0$.

### Game
The probability of winning 4-0 is ${4\choose 0}/2^4$, so $G(4) = 1/16$.

The probability of winning 4-1 is $({5\choose 1}-{4\choose 0})/2^5$, so
$G(3) = 1/8$.

The probability of winning 4-2 is
$({6\choose 2}-{5\choose 1})/2^6 = 5/32$.

The probability of getting to 4-3 or 3-4 is
$({7\choose 3}-{6\choose 2})/2^7 = 5/32$.

After that, the probability of winning the game from being down a point,
$p(-1) = p(0)/2$.  The probability of winning the game from being tied is
$p(0) = p(-1)/2 + p(1)/2$.  The probability of winning the game from being
up a point is $p(1) = 1/2 + p(0)/2$.  So $p(1) = 3/4$, $p(0) = 1/2$,
$p(-1) = 1/4$.

Then, the probability of winning is $5/32\cdot 3/4 + 5/32\cdot 1/4 = 5/32$,
so $G(2) = 5/32 + 5/32 = 5/16$.

### Tiebreak
The probability of winning 7-0 is ${7\choose 0}/2^7$, so $T(7) = 1/128$.

The probability of winning 7-1 is $({8\choose 1}-{7\choose 0})/2^8$, so
$T(6) = 7/256$.

The probability of winning 7-2 is $({9\choose 2}-{8\choose 1})/2^9$, so
$T(5) = 7/128$.

The probability of winning 7-3 is $({10\choose 3}-{9\choose 2})/2^{10}$, so
$T(4) = 21/256$.

The probability of winning 7-4 is $({11\choose 4}-{10\choose 3})/2^{11}$, so
$T(3) = 105/1024$.

The probability of winning 7-5 is
$({12\choose 5}-{11\choose 4})/2^{12} = 231/2048$.

The probability of getting to 7-6 or 6-7 is
$({13\choose 6}-{12\choose 5})/2^{13} = 231/2048$, so $T(2) = 231/1024$.

### Set

$2S(0) \approx 0.0155$, $2S(-1) \approx 0.00793$, $2S(-2) \approx 0.00363$.

### Match

[Simulations](20240712.go) show that $M(12) \approx 0.058$ is the maximum, and
drops off to $M(20) \approx 0.025$ and $M(2) \approx 0.025$ and
$M(0) \approx 0.018$, $M(-1) \approx 0.015$, $M(-2) \approx 0.012$,
$M(-3) \approx 0.0095$.

The probability of winning in 2 sets with a point differential $p$ is

$$
    \sum_{q=-10}^{24} S(q) S(p-q)
$$

The probability of winning in 3 sets with a point differential $p$ is

$$
    2\sum_{q=-10}^{24} \sum_{r=-10}^{24} S(q) S(r) S(p-q+r)
$$

So then

$$
    M(p) = \sum_{q=-10}^{24} S(q) S(p-q)
         + 2\sum_{q=-10}^{24} \sum_{r=-10}^{24} S(q) S(r) S(p-q+r)
$$

And, using code, $2\sum_{p=-44}{-1} M(p)$ works out to
366382889151794439050218364931384718435785359829 /
5846006549323611672814739330865132078623730171904,
or about 6.27%, which agrees with the simulation.
